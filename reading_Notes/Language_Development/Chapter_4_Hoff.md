## Adult Phonological Knowledge

### Sounds of Language

- are acoustic signals used to express meaning
- 200 sounds are used in human language, 45 for Englsih
- Representation of meaning?

	- distinctive feature

	  that leads to contrasting meaning, Bsp. aspiration is not contrastive in English, pill and spill example. Therefore aspiration is not distinctive feature in English.

	- Phones

	  are the different sounds a language uses

	- Phonemes

	  are the meaningfully different sounds in a given language

	- Allophones

	  are phones that do not differentiate meaning, e.g. aspiration

### Phonological Structure of Words

- syllables

	- onset (n in nap)
	- rime (ap in nap)
	- Speech errors

	  Adults make speech errors in which phonemes are moved from one word to another in a sentence, thus providing evidence that at some level of mental representation a word is composed of separable phonemes. 
	  spoonerisms <- William Archibald Spooner, a guy who is proficient at producing speech errors

### Phonotactics

Knowledge of constraints on the sequencing of sounds is termed phonotactic knowledge. Bsp. A native English speaker could tell that zloty is not a legal English word, because the consonant cluster 'zl' cannot start a word in English, though permissible in Polish.

### Phonological Rules

- Voicing Assimilation Rule

  bugs /z/ & bikes /s/

- the Wug test -> young children has this knowledge by 4-year-old

  Jean Berko, 1958
  present children with novel words like wug and rick and found that ,by the age of 4, children were able to correctly indicate that plural of wug was wug/z/ and that the past tense of rick was rick/t/.
  
  Children commonly have trouble producing the word spaghetti, and they frequently transform the first syllable from spa to pas. Often when they do this--although not always--the s gets pronounced /z/, so the resulting word is pazghetti. The voicing assimilation is observed, though the word is not quite right.

### Adult's knowledge include

- the sound used in their languages
- sound distinction that signals meaning distinctions
- possible sound sequence

## Speech Sounds Description

### Phonetics

When a word is being spelled phonetically, the standard is to enclose it in brackets. English word pill is represented as [phil] and spill as [spil]. the h indicates aspiration.

### Phonemics

Since it is sufficient to indicate just the sounds  that are phonemes(that produce meaning-contrasting sound), unnecessary detail can be removed in phonemics. In English, aspiration can be excluded. pill can be expressed as just [pil].

### Phonetic Features

- Articulatory phonetics

	- make use of phonetic features
	- consonants

		- place of articulation
		- manner of articulation
		- voicing

		  voicing refers to the time the vocal cords start vibrating relative to the release of air. The consonant /p/ is called voiceless because the vocal cords do not start to vibrate until after lips have released air, whereas in producing the voiced sound /b/, the vocal cords start vibrating before air is released.

	- vowel

		- Height

		  how high or low is the tongue in the mouth?

		- Backness

		  how forward or back is the tongue in the mouth?

		- Lip attitude

		  are the lips rounded?

## Prelinguistic Speech Sound Development

### Stages of Prespeech Vocal Development

- 1) Reflexive crying and vegetative sounds

  * cries, burps, sneezes and other sounds that accompany the biological functions of breathing, sucking and so on.
      * the airflow through the vocal apparatus is stopped and started

- 2) Cooing and laughter

  * 6-8 weeks
      * Coos are sounds that babies make when they appear to be happy and contended.
      * Social interaction in particular seems to elicit cooing
      * Quality of cooing changes 
          * start to add a variety of different vowel-like sounds into the cooing
          * instead of single sound, infants produce a series of different vowel-like sounds strung together but separated by intakes of breath.
      * first laughter at 16 weeks

- 3) Vocal play / expansion stage

  * 16-30 weeks
      * different consonant-like and vowel-like sounds that infants produce increases
      * also produce squeals, growls and a variety of friction noises
      * marginal babbling is the long series of sounds that infants produced at the end of expansion stage
      * at first couple of months, only vowel-like sounds are recognizable
      * at 2 - 3 months, recognizable consonant-like sounds, tend to be the one produced in the back of the mouth (velars), e.g. [g], [k]
      * at 6 months, produce consonant-like sounds in the front of the mouth, e.g. [m], [n], [p], [b], and [d]

- 4) Reduplicated babbling

  * 6 - 9 months
      * canonical babbling
      * e.g. [dada] or [nanana]
      * deaf infants rarely produce canonical babbling

- 5) Nonreduplicated babbling / variegated babbling

  * combine CV or CVC syllables into series
      * prosody: intonation becomes noticeable
      * infants sounds though they are speaking, until you listen closely and realize that the infant is producing the melody of language without the words. These wordless sentences is called jargon. (yum yum means food)

### Target Language Influence

- Babbling Drift (R. Brown, 1958a)

	- sounds baby use is influenced by the language they hear
	- begin at 6-month-old
	- Two methods

	  - Method 1: use judgments of competent speakers to determine whether they can tell the differences among the babbling of babies who are acquiring different languages
	              - de Boyssson-Bardies, Sagart, and Durand, 1984
	                  - French, Arabic and Chinese babies babbling
	                  - Results: French speakers were able to make that judgment at better-than-chance levels on the basis of the recordings of 8-month-olds. (70% correct);  10-month-old are harder to tell apart, because in the more advanced babbling of the 10-month, the consonant sounds are more noticeable but the prosodic characteristics that differentiate the babbling becomes less noticeable.
	  
	          - Method 2: record babbling of children who are acquiring different languages and analyze them for the presence and frequency of features in the respective adult languages.
	              - de Boysson-Bardies, Halle, Sagart, Durand, 1989
	                  - vowels and consonants in babbling depend on characteristics of the ambient language, observable at 9-month-old
	                  - Japanese and French words contain more nasal sounds than Swedish and English words do, and analysis of the babies babbling showed that Japanese and French babies use more nasal sounds in their babbling than Swedish and English babies do.

### Speech Sounds at the End of the Babbling Stage

- 11 consonants inventory for 90% of English acquiring babies

  /h, w, j, p, b, m, t, d, n, k, g/
  J. L. Locke & Pearson, 1992
  
  English acquiring babies rarely produce consonant clusters such as /kl/ or /pr/. (Vihman, 1988a)

### Babbling-word Transition

- Invented word -> protowords (Bates, 1976)

  at the transition state between the end of babbling and first word, are sound sequences children use with consistent meanings but that bear no discernible resemblance to the sound of any word in the target language.
  
  Other names, sensorimotor morphemes (Carter, 1978), quasiwords (Stoel-Gammon & Cooper, 1984), phonetically consistent forms (Dore, Franklin, Miller, & Ramer, 1976)

### Underlying Process of Infants' Development

- biological maturation

	- growth of facial skeleton provide room for the tongue

	  the newborn infants’ vocal tract is smaller and shaped differently than the adult’s, with the result that the tongue fills the entire mouth and severely limits its range of motion. Growth of the facial skeleton during the period of vocal play gives the tongue more room and probably contributes to the increased variety of sounds infants can make at this time

	- maturation of muscles & sensory receptors of the vocal tract
	- maturation of central nervous system

	  since vegetative sounds are controlled by the very primitive structures in the brain stem, cooing requires areas in the limbic system (associated with human emotion, like contentedness)

	- advanced motor control

- Experience

	- 1) hearing the speech adults produce

	  children who hear less speech because of frequent fluid buildup in their ears develop canonical babbling a little bit later than normal children (Polka et al., 2007)

	- 2) the experience of hearing their own vocal output

	  deaf infants reach the stage of canonical babbling much later than hearing infants, which may be caused by the absence of auditory feedback (Oller & Eilers, 1988)

	- 3) social feedback

		- Maternal Responsiveness

		  maternal responsiveness to infant vocalization increases the rate of infant vocalization (Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1989; Rheingold, Gewirtz, Ross, 1959)
		  
		  Mothers were instructed to respond to their infants’ vocalization with consonant-vowel syllables. A separate group of infants heard that the infants who heard consonant-vowel syllables contingent on their own vocalizations came to produce more of these advanced vocalizations. (Goldstein, King, West, 2003; Goldstein, Schwade, 2008)

		- Guidance towards mature types of vocalizations

		  social feedback guides infants toward more mature types of vocalizations (Goldstein, Schwade, 2010)

		- Been treated as conversation partner

		  mothers respond differently to their infants’ vocalization depending on whether they are the less mature vowel-like sounds  or the more mature consonant-vowel syllables. the mothers were particularly likely to treat the infants’ consonant-vowel vocalizations as though they were meaningful by acknowledging those sounds (e.g. saying “Oh really?”) and by imitating and expanding on those sounds. In contrast, when the infants produced vowel-like sounds, the mothers were more likely to respond with noises that did not carry meaning (Gros-Louis, West, Goldstein, & King, 2006)

## Phonological Development Once Speech Begins

### Word Recognition

- rough/holistic representations

	- pronounce individual segments differently from word to word

	  Ferguson & Farwell, 1975, and Vihman et al., 2009

	- insensitive to differences among unfamiliar words at phonetic segments level

	  From word recognition tasks in which children appear to be insensitive to differences between words at the level of individual phonetic segments and to base their judgments on syllables or whole words. (Walley, 1993)
	  
	  Using looking-while-listening procedure, it is observed that 18-23 months old babies do differentiate individual phonetic change for familiar word, e.g. baby was pronounced as vaby. (Swingley, & Aslin, 2000)
	  
	  11-month-olds showed sensitivity to small mispronunciations like those shown above. (Swingley, 2005)

- consonants more important than vowels in word identification

  (Hochmann, Benvides-Varela, Nespor, & Mehler, 2011)
  
  The ratio of consonants to vowels in a language influences the ease with which children can start to recognize words and thus influences the timing of early vocabulary growth. CHildren acquiring Danish get off to a slower start in word learning than children acquiring other languages, and in Danish the ratio of consonants to vowels in running speech is very low. (Bleses, Vach, Slott, Wehberg, Thomsen, Madsen, & Basboll, 2008)

### Word Learning

- Inconsistent performance: CAN differentiate between single phonemes but CANT when its within a minimum pair

  present 14 months old and 18-24 months old with two different object-sound pairs. The infants saw a plastic model of a molecule and heard dih over and over until they habituated; the infants saw a toy crown while hearing bih again and again until habituated. Then switch the object-sound pairing. Can infants notice the difference? 14-month-old can't, but 18-month-old can.(Werker, Cohen, Lloyd, Casasola, & Stager, 1998)
  very young children fail to distinguish newly taught words if the words differ by only one segment (Garnica, 1973; Shvachin, 1948/1973)

	- Explanation 1: Insufficient cognitive resource to register phonetical details

	  The multiple demands of the word-learning task do not leave the child with sufficient resources to register all the phonetic details of newly encountered words. When children are busy paying attention to a new object and a new sound sequence, they create only a rough representation of what the new sound sequence is like. That rough representation is not sufficient to distinguish dih from bih.

	- Explanation 2: Children assume sounds are non-contrasting sounds

	  Children do form phonetically detailed representations, but they don't assume that the sound contrast matters (Thiessen & Yee, 2010). Child don't distinguish /d/ and /b/ if he don't know word begins with them, e.g. dog and bog.
	  
	  supported by
	  Children with larger vocabularies were more successful in Werker's test.

### Word Production

- first word use a small inventory of vowels and consonants (Ingram, 1999)
- some adult sounds are consistently absent

  e.g. /ð/, /θ/, /l/, /r/ are consistently missing; while /m/, /b/, and /d/ are consistently present

- Inconsistency

	- onset of purse and pretty pronounced differently
	- phonological idioms

	  are words the child produces in a very adultlike way, while still incorrectly producing other words that use the very same sounds.

- Phonological Process

  at circa 18 months children develop a systematic way in which to alter the sounds of the target langauge so they fit within the repertoire of sounds they can produce.

	- Reduplication

	  bottle as /baba/; mommy as /mama/

	- canonical forms

	  children may assimilate a new word either to another similar-sounding word in their lexicons or to a preexisting whole-word sound pattern, so as to keep the word within their sound repertoire
	  
	  Bsp. modify all words to fit the pattern CV/j/VC
	  panda as /pajan/, berries as /bjas/ and tiger as /tajak/ (Priestly, 1977; Vihman, 1988a)

- Motoric difficulty/Articulatory Complexity
- Functional Load

	- Importance of a phoneme in marking contrast

	  In English, the initial sound in the and this is very frequently heard because it is used in a few very high-frequency words. However, because that sound is not involved in many different words, its functional significance is low, and it is acquired late in children acquiring English

### Cross-Linguistic Difference

children acquiring English, /v/ is relatively late-appearing sound, but among children acquiring Swedish, Bulgarian, and Estonian, /v/ is a much earlier acquisition (Pye, Ingram, & List, 1987)

In English, /v/ has low functional load, but in the above languages, /v/ is more important to marking the difference between different words.

### Individual Difference

- intonation babies

  who babble long strings of jargon with the intonation contour of the target language.

- word babies

  who tend to produce one short babble sequence at a time (Dore, 1975)

- differ in particular sounds acquired

  some children just prefer particular sounds (Vihman, 1993)

- differ in approach to acquisition

	- some rely on whole-word process
	- different reduplication: blanket as /baba/ or /bat/

### Phonological Awareness

Knowledge of the phonological system (e.g. use pronunciation /z/ in the plural form of bug and /s/ in the plural form of bike) is not conscious to the owner of such knowledge. Most speakers could not say why they use different pronunciation. In contrast, phonological awareness is the conscious knowledge, that adults can use it to identify rhyme, count syllables, and think of five different words that begin with /t/.

- Conscious knowledege
- ryhmes
- legal phonotactic form
- voicing assimilation

## Phonological R Lexical development

### First word tend to be the easy-to-produce word

- short

  - typical short (one or two syllables) and have consonants that are among the first consonants that children produce. (Stoel-Gammon, 2011)

- open syllables

  - first words tend to be made up of open syllables—a consonant followed by a vowel, such as mama or bye-bye.

- cross-linguistic evidence: Cantonese

  this pattern also found in Cantonese, words children tend to acquire between 16-22 months use early-acquired speech sounds more than words acquired later (Stoel-Gammon, Sosa, 2007)

### Vocabulary content affected by children's phonological system

- less canonical syllables in babbling -> slower word producing

  - children whose babble contains relatively few canonical syllables are often slower to begin producing words (Rescorla, Ratner, 1996; Stoel-Gammon, 1991)

- large phonetic inventory -> large vocabulary

  children with larger phonetic inventories tend to have larger vocabularies (B. L. Smith, McGregor, Demille, 2006; Stoel-Gammon, Sosa, 2007)

- faster learning of new words if words conform to productive abilities

  - In experiment set-up, children more readily learn new words that conform to their individual productive abilities than words that do not (Schwartz, Leonard, 1982)

### Lexical development drives phonological development

In order to support the more detailed representations of the sounds of words, children need a mental system of the sounds that words are composed of. Lexical development is a factor that pushes the child to a phonological analysis of his or her language and to the representation of a phonological system. (Beckman, Edwards, 2000; Gerken, 1994; Metal, Walley, 1998; Walley, 1993)

- neighborhood similarity

  - The neighborhood of a word is all the other words in the vocabulary that differ by only one phoneme. 
          - The neighborhood density increases as vocabulary grows—that is, in a bigger vocabulary, each word resides in a denser neighborhood. Words in deniers neighborhoods must be represented on greater phonological detail in order to be distinct. (Charles-Luce, Luce, 1990)
          - 3-5 years old children made finer-grained distinctions in judging the similarity of words intense neighborhoods than words in spares neighborhoods. (Storkel, 2002)
          - The proportion of words in a child’s vocabulary that are neighbors declines with increasing vocabulary size. (Coady, Aslin, 2003)
          - children as young as 111 months represent segmental information argues against accounts in which such refinement of lexical representations depends on later vocabulary growth (Swingley, 2005)

## Phonological Development in Detail

### Behaviorist Theory

- tenet

  Babies produce the sounds they do because they imitate the sounds they hear and because they receive positive reinforcement for doing so

- evidence for

	- responses -> more vocalization

	  responding to infant's vocalizations causes the infants to vocalize more.

	- contingent responses -> advanced vocalization

	  mothers tend to produce different responses to more advanced vocalizations than to less advanced vocalizations and that infants appear to benefit from the provision of contingent responses

- evidence against

	- ignore biological development of vocal tract
	- not frequency of sound input but functional load and phonotactic probability
	- phonology development ≠ sound repertoire development; there are unconscious knowledge

	  The development of phonology is the development of mental representations of the phonemes and the acquisition of a system of regularities in how sounds combine. These AREN'T conscious knowledge and AREN'T available for reinforcement.

### Universalist Approaches

- UG provides everything

  phonological component of UG provides the child with the set of phonetic features and phonological properties that are present in all languages. The task for children is only to learn which of the set of universal features and rules operate in their language. (Roman Jakobsonin, 1941)
  
  N. Chomsky, & Halle 1968, The Sound Pattern of English
  
  N. Smith, 1973

- supplanted by Optimality Theory

  Prince & Smolensky, 1997
  the phonological properties of words must be described at multiple levels, e.g. words are strings of segments but they also are made up of syllables that have a prosodic structure. Phonological regularities reflect universal constraints, but languages differ in the ranking of those constraints.

### Biologically Based Theory

- tenet

	- sound production and its development are shaped by motor capacity and its development

	  The biological basis to vocal development is the reason for the similarities among the early sound repertoires of children acquiring different languages.
	  
	  J. L. Lock, 1983, 1993

- evidence for

	- biological factors shape adult speech

	  The sounds that appear early in infants' vocal productions are also common sounds among the world's languages. Sounds produced late in the course of development tend to be rare in the world's languages.
	  
	  /m/ is among the first sounds babies produce, 97% of world languages have /m/ among their phonemes.
	  The American /r/ is a sound that causes difficulties for children even into the school years, and this sound is a phoneme in only 5% of world's languages.

		- /m/ and American /r/

	- child phonological process also seem in adult speech -> underlying biological principles

	  Donegan & Stampe, 1979; Bernhadt & Stemberger, 1998 state this view.
	  
	  Vihman, 1988a:
	  children commonly substitute voiceless for voiced consonants at the ends of words, such as pronouncing bad as /bat/ and many languages have a rule that voiced consonants are pronounced as their voiceless counterparts in word-final position (e.g. knives-knife, leaves-leaf)

- evidence against

	- language experience is more important than mere motor capacity

### Usage Based Phonology

- tenet

  phonological development is shaped by properties of the input children hear.
  
  It contrasts with UG in which innately specified properties of language determine the course of language development(Zamuner, 2003)
  
  There are not innate phonetic features, but rather children build their phonetic categories from the ground up from acoustic properties of the speech signal (Ambridge & Lieven 2011; Pierrehumbert, 2003)
  
  Children learn the phonological regularities of their language on the basis of the regularities in the language they experience.

- evidence for

  children's tendencies not to articulate word final consonants do not reflect a preference for open syllables in UG but rather arise from basic human abilities of perception and production, in combination with the patterns in the ambient language.
  Evidence:
  children do learn the phonetic categories of their languages from the distributional properties of acoustic signals in their input is consistent with this view (Maye et al., 2002)
  Children do not drop all word final consonants with equal frequency but rather that children's productions reflect the patterns in their input is another example of a finding consistent with a usage-based account of phonological development (Zamuner et al., 2004, 2005)

### Connectionist Approach

- tenet

	- phonological knowledge is represented by constructs of neural networks.

	  Plaut, Kello, 1999; Storkel, Morrisette, 2002

	- Rules are not to describe the regularities in human behavior
