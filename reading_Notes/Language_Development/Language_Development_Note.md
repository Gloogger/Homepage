## Features of Adults' Knowledge of Language Structure

### Productivity/Generativity of Language

- Productivity = Capacity to produce and understand an infinite number of novel sentences
- New sentences -> completely unique
- We understand sentences that we had never heard before

### Syntax

- Is component of grammar, governs order of words in sentences
- 2 Categories

	- Open-class words

		- content words / lexical categories
		- Categories noun, verb, adj.
		- One can always invent new n., v., adj. Bsp., "The blick torpedo the fepish woog."

	- Closed-class words

		- function words / functional categories
		- Auxiliaries, e.g. 'can', 'will'
		- prep., e.g. 'of', 'in'
		- complementizers, e.g. 'that', 'who'
		- determiners, e.g., 'the', 'a'
		- one cannot invent new words, because the number of grammatical functions is limited

- Nature of sentence structure

	- NOT linear arrangements of content
	- BUT hierarchical structures

### Morphology

- Minimal unit that carries meaning, e.g. the plural inflectional suffix 's', as in books
- Bound Morpheme

	- cannot stand alone, MUST be attached to a word

- Free Morpheme

	- can stand alone as words

- Inflectional Morpheme

	- Add grammatical information to words
	- Does NOT change meaning or grammatical category
	- English: small collection of bound morphemes; Hungarian, rich morphological system, need to conjugate each noun
	- Acquisition of Language with rich morphological system

		- motivation to study languages other than English

### Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Rules

- Implicit knowledge of rules of L
- Implicit rules â‰  prescriptive rules of grammar taught in English class

## Grammatical Development: Evidence in L Production

### Transition from 1 word speech

- one-word stage

	- When children start to put words together in longer sequences, they also start to add function words and bound morphemes
	- Characteristics of First Word Combinations

		- Lack function words
		- Lack bound morphemes for plural, possessive and tense

	- after few months of 1-word stage, begin to put two words together, Bsp., 'Daddy shirt'
	- utterances change in reliable & predictable ways

- Transition

	- Evidence of grammatical knowledge

		- combine units of language in a single utterance
		- Appearance of multiword utterance -> Beginning of structured speech

	- blur the distinction between 1-word & 2-word stages

- Vertical Constructions

	- children utter successive single-word that are semantically related as those in 2-word utterance, Bsp., Ow, Eye.
	- Utterances that build on someone else's previous utterance
	- Scallon, 1979

		- researchers transcribe what children say on a new line, so it is called vertical 

- Unanalyzed word: Word+Jargon

	- Some multiword phases are memorized as unanalyzed wholes 
	- Do NOT reflect on the development of word combination ability
	- 'Iwant' and 'Idontknow' but not 'youwant' or 'youdontknow'
	- sounds like 'mumble mumble mumble cookie?'

### Early Syntax

- Two-word combinations

	- Evidence of productivity in the boy's limited vocabulary

		- Could say anything is big or little; could say Daddy and Andrew walk and sleep

	- Relational Meanings

		- First word combination limited to relational meanings
		- The relation between the referents of the words in a word combination
		- Bsp., my teddy
		- Brown, 1973
		- Particular semantic relationships

			- Reflect level of cognitive development

		- Particular words

			- Reflect the language children are exposed to

- Three-word combination

### Telegraphic Nature of Early Combinatorial Speech

- Words in initial sentences uttered by children are words from majority grammatical categories of n., v., and adj.
- Missing determiners, prep, aux, bound morpheme

	- But Why?

		- Because use of these words are tied to particular grammatical entities
		- These words are not essential to meaning

			- Children have cognitive limitations on length of utterance they can produce
			- Children sensibly leave out the least important parts due to length limitation
			- Omitted words are not stressed in adults' utterances

### Morphological Development

- in children acquiring English

	- Missing forms begin to appear at 3-word stage
	- Famous longitudinal studies

		- Adam, Eve, and Sarah (Brown, 1973)

	- Generalizations

		- 1) Transition takes a long time

			- First grammatical morphemes appear @3-word-stage
			- Most grammatical morphemes are reliably used only after 1 years later

		- 2) Acquisition of grammatical morphemes is not an all-or-none phenomenon

		  Either for the morphemes as a group or even at the level of individual morphemes

			- Different morphemes first appear at different times
			- It takes a long time between its first appearance and reliable usage

		- 3) Order of 14 different morphemes is similar across different children

			- Eve and Sarah acquired in similar orders, different in rates 

	- de Villiers

		- Same general order of development is true in sample of 21 children at different levels of language development
		- Children who had only a few grammatical morphemes were likely to have only those that first appeared in Adam, Eve and Sarah's data
		- Children who had a late-appearing morpheme were likely to have all the earlier appearing ones as well 

- in children acquiring languages other than English

	- English acquiring kid: only need to learn that subjects precede and objects follow the verb
	- Hungarian acquiring children: learn the 18 different distinctions among roles of nouns and add a different suffix to the noun depending on the role the it serves 
	- A system this is regular and predictable, such as Turkish, results in fewer errors committed by children learning the system than a system with many exceptions like Russian
	- Within language, some grammatical morphemes seem easier to acquire than others
	- Morphemes are easy to acquire when they are frequent and have recognizable form (form stays the same across different linguistic environments, unlike English plural which takes three different forms)
	- It also seems to help if the morphemes are easy to segment from the steam and if the rhythm of the language makes the morphemes perceptually salient

### Development of Different Sentence Forms 

- Imperative sentences (commands) tend to be the most frequent forms at first, declaratives become the most frequent sentence @30-month, and questions are always the least frequent category, but they become more frequent as the children get older
- Children do not wait until they have acquired the adult means of expression to make negative statements and to form questions 
- The means of expressing negation and questions changes
- Expressing negations

	- Earliest linguistic means of expressing negation heard in speech of children acquiring English use is the addition of negative marker (usually not or no) to the beginning or end of the sentence 
	- Some kids mark negation non linguistically by shaking their heads as they utter an affirmative statement 
	- Following the sentence external means of marking negation, children produce utterances in which they are still not adult like because they don't yet use auxiliaries 
	- Children acquire auxiliaries and their negative expressions take the adult form

- Asking  Questions

	- There are two types of questions: yes/no and wh- questions 

		- In yes/no answers, auxiliaries are added to the beginning of the utterance, which suffices to construct a grammatical yes/no question 
		- Wh- questions are not adult like because children do not invert the subject and auxiliary, instead producing utterances like "what a doctor can do?

	- Children's first yes/no are usually marked only by intonation AND wh- queens are typically affirmative statement with a wh- word at the beginning such as "what that is?"

- Passive forms

	- passives are rare in speech in adults but useful when speaker wishes to make the object of the verb prominent Bsp., "My cat got run over by a bus."
or when they don't wish to specify the agent of the action at all, as in mistakes were made 
	- @3.5-yr-old, children produce passive forms in their spontaneous speech and frequency of passives in children's speech continues to grow even after @5-year-old
	- the two forms of passives tend to be used to express different sorts of meanings, both by adults and children from the time they first began to produce passives

- Complex Sentences

	- After development of grammatical morphemes and different sentence forms is well on its way, the next grammatical development is the appearance of sentences that contain more than one closed (ie. more than one verb) 
	- appear in children's spontaneous speech much easier than others do, usually after children regularly produced 4-word utterances @2-year-old
	- @2-3 years old, children add to their repertoire of complex constructions and use them with increasing frequency
	- @4-year-old, children use most of the different complex sentence types by age 4

### Individual Differences in grammatical development

- differed in

	- Rate

		- Differences in rate are the obvious
		- Some children produce multiword utterances at age 18 months, whereas others do not start combining words until they are 2 years old 

	- Course

		- less obvious are differences in the kinds of multiword utterances children produce
		- Some kids early's multiwords utterances are clearly rote learned as whole; while others are more like combinations of separate words from the start
		- Differences in kind of multiword utterances children produce may originate in differences in what children attend to and therefore how children perceive the speech they hear 
		- Child kids pay attention to syllables and phonemes; others pay more attention to the overall prosodic "tune"
		- Tune/holistic/top-down approach

			- "holistic" or top-down, results in many unanalyzed chunks 

		- Analytic/bottom-up approach

			- breaking down into smaller units and them combining them 
			- Children eventually must figure out the smallest units and how to combine them, the holistic approach to combinatorial speech is not necessarily a dead end
			- Some kids may "break into structure" by starting with unanalyzed phrases and then identifying slots in these phrases that can be occupied by different lexical items 
			- At this intermediary stage, a child may have a repertoire of rules that allow very limited productivity

		- Braine, 1976

			- Most children use both top-down and bottom-up strategies and most children include both unanalyzed chunks and smaller units in their early sentences 
			- Children may differ in how much they rely on one strategy vs. the other
			- Called rules limited-scope formulas

### Measuring grammatical development from spontaneous speech

- As their grammar improves, they can produce longer and better utterances 
- Children's spontaneous speech provides a basis for measuring their grammatical development 
- MLU

	- Most basic measure
	- calculated from the number of words and is also frequently calculated in terms of morphemes
	- Relation to age for the three children: Adam, Eve and Sarah 

		- Children had very different MLUs 

	- MLU provides a better indicator of child's level of productive grammar than does age, at least up to an MLU of 3.0
	- Even children with similar MLUs can differ in the nature of their utterances; some kids lengthen them primarily by adding content words and others use bound morphemes 
	- After MLU exceeds 3, its usefulness as a predictor of the complexity of children's utterances declines 
	- For some kids acquiring English, MLU has been used as the basis for somewhat arbitrary dividing syntactic development into 5 stages, and we can use this stage terminology to summarize the major developments in the course of children's acquisition of the syntax and morphology of English we have just described 

		- Stage 1: children begin to combine words 
		- Stage 2: children begin to add grammatical morphemes to their word combinations 
		- Stage 3: children begin to use different sentence modalities (negative and question)
		- Stage 4: children begin to use complex sentences
		- Stage 5: new forms of complex sentences emerge in stage 5 

## Grammatical Development: Evidence in L Comprehension

- Picture of grammatical development that can be constructed from studies of comprehension is not as continuous as the pictures the emerges from studies of production 
- No such thing as a record of spontaneous comprehension that would be the counterpart to the transcripts that are records of children's spontaneous productions
- We try to find out what aspects of grammatical structure children understand, one must devise a way of testing for comprehension of particular structures 
- Just by talking to children and seeing whether they respond appropriately is not sufficient because children have a variety of ways of responding appropriately, even without truly understanding the structure of what they hear 
- Strategies for responding are sufficiently successful that if you ask parents of 1 year olds how much they understand of the speech that they hear, most will probably say "everything"

### Strategies used by children

- Response Strategies

	- enable them to reopen dot speech they only partially understand 
	- Very young kids are particularly likely to respond to speech by doing something 
	- Allows children to produce appropriate responses to much of what is typically said to them
	- Bsp., "Why don't you play with your blocks?" Child will probably satisfy them and play with the blocks 
	- Success of this strategy depends on the child's ability to figure out the correct action without fully understanding the sentence

- Strategies reveal children's syntactic ignorance

	- Bsp., "do you need a dry diaper?"
The little boy felt his diaper and ran to his room, and returned with a clean diaper in hand

		- The child appeared to have fully understood his father's question.
		- his father changed his diaper after with the cleans ones that he brought. he indirectly showed that he understood what dad said 

- What do children know about syntactic structure?

	- 1) One sentence comprehension strategy

		- A word order strategy which treats whatever is mentioned first in the sentence as the subject and whatever is mentioned second as the object 
		- Allows children to correctly act out "the swing bumps the kitty" and "the kitty bumps the swing".. this strategy produces incorrect responses to passive sentences like "the swing was bumped by the events is the order of mention strategy. 
		- Works for interpreting sentence

	- 2) Using recourse to world knowledge

		- 2.1) Probable-event strategy

			- Allows children to correctly act out sentences like "the mouse was chased by the cat", even though the word order strategy doesn't work here 
			- Children using the strategy will reverse the sequence of events when presented with non probable sentences like "i broke my balloon because i cried" 

### Children's comprehension

- In English: the order in which words are combined carries meanings doc children learning English show that they are aware of language-typical word order patterns and that they are sensitive to the meaning carried by word order before they produce word combinations 
- Study 1

	- Infant preference between two sets of auditory stimuli is measured by how much time is needed to get the experimenter to play that recording
	- Doesn't mean that all @12-month-old knew what the sentences meant, but it does mean that they knew something about the word order pattern 
	- When children are presented with normal and scrambled Spanish sentences, children learning English showed no preference but Spanish-speaking did 
	- Children show sensitivity to meaning carried by word order @16-month 

- Study 2

	- @16-18 month olds 
	- Mostly one word speakers
	- Distinguished the difference between the meanings of contrasting pairs of sentences like "Where is cookie monster washing big bird?" and "where i big bird washing bookie monster?"

- Experiment

	- One word speakers between the ages of 16-24 months 
	- Correctly responded to unlikely two word instructions like "kiss keys" and "tickle book"

- Early Comprehension of grammatical morphemes

  - Children also seem to know that grammatical morphemes do something in a sentnece before they are actually producing grammatical morphemes in their own sentences 
  - Children who were telegraphic speakers found to be more likely to respond to a well-formed command like "throw me the ball" than to a command that matched their own productive speech like "throw ball" 
  
  - Children in this case might know only that the telegraphic utterance isn't quite right, rather than understanding any info carried by the omitted morphemes 
  - There is evidence that children actually derive info from the function morphemes that they hear before they have control over the use of them in production 
  
  - Children with MLU >1.5 were better able to find the correct picture when told "find the dog for me" than when they were given an ungrammatical sentence in which the wrong function morpheme was used (like find was dog for me) 
  
  Two basic conclusions can be drawn from this account of early grammatical development based on studies of language comprehension 
  - Sequence of grammatical develop that occurs in comprehension is like the sequence seen in production but it occurs earlier 
  (difference of lag between achievement in comprehension and evidence in production is different for a variety of kids) 
  SO: an individual's comprehension skills are not a very good predictor of that child's level of productive grammar 
  - Grammatical competente is achieved very early 
  
  - Good grammar is acquired, it is a process accomplished very quickly by young children

- Comprehension of underlying structural relations

	- Showing that children have grammatical knowledge earlier than they display it in production

	  Comprehension studies offer the posibility of finding evidence go grammatical knowledge that would not be revealed in speech production at all

	- Child's performance in response to questions makes it clear that they know subtle aspects of complex syntax at a very young age

- Difficulties Understanding Coreference relations in complex sentences by older children

	- Acquisition of grammar is pretty much done @4-yrs-old
	- Some parts of grammar are hard for older children, often has to do with confusion about whom or what is being referred to

		- Problem is in the interpreting the coreference relations in the sentences

	- Chomsky

		- Studied comprehension of the sentence forms in children @5-10 years olds 
		- Results: most @5-yrs have difficulty with sentences and that some don't fully master these complex ones until @9-yrs
		- @5-yrs children have not acquired all strategies that look into meaning, context and surface properties of the sentence for clues to sentence interpretation 

	- UG

		- innate in all children 
		- According to the generative linguistic approach, coreference relation are a component of UG
		- Contradiction: UG is innate and handles interpretation of coreference relations yet children who have UG in their heads struggle with interpreting coreference relations

	- Alternative approach

		- Children are not born with an adult system but it develops over time 
		- Possibilities

			- They interpret sentences using strategies involving meaning and pragmatics of surface features rather than relying on purely linguistic principles 

				- asserts that developmental change in kid's underlying grammars occurs; children's initial systems are not the  same as adult's grammatical systems

			- OR
			- Children do have full adult knowledge but cannot display it because of processing limitations 

				- asserts that the underlying system stays the same, even though performance does change

### Production precedes comprehension (sometimes)

- Sometimes children are able to show that they understand grammatical structures they product in their own spontaneous speech 
- Possibilities

	- Sometimes children are able to show that they understand grammatical structures they product in their own spontaneous speech 
	- OR
	- For children to use structures correctly in a limited way, without necessarily knowing Severin about those structure 

### Processes of Sentence Comprehension

- Studies

	- Comprehension was studied as a means of asking about children's grammatical knowledge 
	- Others have examined the process of comprehension itself 
	- Mostly done using eye trackers 
	- Some research presents visual worlds on a computer screen and used children's movements on the computer mouse in an analogous way 
	- Interesting finding: when adults are studied, they behaviors show that they use nonlinguistic context the process of sentence interpretation 

		- Children are less influenced yb nonlinguistic context than adults and more likely to hang onto meanings that is most consistent with the frequent use (ex: put the frog on the napkin)
		- Children who have more language experience armoire adult in the way that process sentences
		- Children that hear more language are faster at processing the words they know

	- Bsp., put the frog on the napkin into the box (your interpretation of hearing napkins will be influenced by presence of frog on a napkin the visual world)
