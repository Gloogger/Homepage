# Chapter 5 Hoff

## Lexical Knowledge in Adults

### Mental Lexicon

- The store of word knowledge

  A dictionary in the head of each speaker. Each word is an entry and each entry specifies the sound of the word, the grammatical category to which the word belongs (e.g. nouns, verbs) and the word's meaning.

### What is Word?

- not just set of meaningful sounds 
- are symbols with arbitrary connection to its referent 
- Reference

	- Words STANDING FOR their referent
	- NOT that words GOING WITH their referent

	  Golinkoff, Mervis, Hirsh-Pasek, 1994
	  one can say 'yikes' each time one sees a particular cat, but that is not necessarily the same thing as referring to the cat. A word to be used consistently in combination with a particular object is not sufficient to qualify that word use as referential

	- NOT all word are referential

		- Greetings
		- Social Routines

## The Course of Early Lexical Development

### First Words

- 10-15 months old

  Benedict, 1979; Fenson et al., 1994; Huttenlocher, Smiley, 1987

- context-bound word use

	- situation-specific cases

		- Allison Bloom: car at window

		  Lois Bloom, 1973
		  at 9-month-old, Allison produce the word car, but she said 'car' only when she was looking out her apartment window at cars on the street below. She did not say 'car' when she saw a car close up or when she saw a picture of a car in a book.

		- Adam Barrett: duck in bathtub

		  Martyn Barrett, 1986
		  at 12 months old, Adam used the word 'duck' only when he was hitting one of his toy yellow ducks off the edge of the bathtub. He never said 'duck' while playing with these toy ducks in other situations, and he never said 'duck' while looking at real ducks

	- function-specific cases

		- 'more' refer to request ONLY but not to comment on recurrence
		- 'no' used to indicate refusal ONLY

		  A. Gopnik, 1988

	- evidence for external validity

	  Caselli et al., 1995
	  sample size = hundreds of American and Italian children
	  children's first words may always be parts of routines or language games.

	- for infants: word only serves as a mean to accomplish a particular goal, not generalized

- Prelexical Stage of Word Use

	- context-bound words aren't real words
	- context-bound words are prelexical words

	  These words are merely responses elicited by particular environmental conditions (Behrend, 1990)

	- children can use labels to refer to objects in new contexts from 9-month-old

	  Poulin-Dubois, Graham, 2007

- First word can be referential: first 10 words 4 children

  recorded using mother diaries.
  Harris, Barratt, Jones, Brookes, 1988

	- 22/40 context-bound
	- 14/40 contextually flexible and nominal
	- 4/40 contextually flexible & not nominal
	- words varies across individuals
	- Why some words are prelexical and some aren't?

		- 1) it takes time to distill meaning from usages in different contexts

		  for 18/22 context-bound words, child's sole use was the same as his or her mother's most frequent use

- Decontextualization

  Context-bound word will gradually become decontextualized
  
  see below
  Barrett, 1986;
  Bates, Benigni, Bretherton, Camaioni, Volterra, 1979;
  Dore, Franklin Miller, Ramer, 1976

	- 2 weeks later, Adam's 'duck' used elsewhere

### First Words -> 50 Words

- 50 w achieved @ 18-month, or within 15-24 months
- Nelson's research

  Katharine Nelson, 1973
  data source: mother diary
  sample size: 18 children 
  Each mother kept a diary and recorded each new word her child produced, along with the date and notes about the context in which the word was used. Mother keep diary until 50th word appears

	- 18 children, mother diary kept until appearance of 50th word
	- 6 categories of children's acquired words

	  specific nominals, e.g. mommy, daddy, Rover
	  general nominals, e.g. dog, ball, milk, or prep e.g. he, this
	  action words, e.g. go, up, look
	  modifiers, e.g. big, all gone, outside, mine
	  personal social words, e.g. no, want, please
	  grammatical function words, e.g. what, is, for

	- nominal words increased both in absolute number & in relative proportion
	- Lexical growth from 10 to 50 words, by word type

### 50 Words Mark

- word reflect infants' experience

	- word come from daily routines

	  Clark, 1979

- predominance of nouns

  Bates et al., 1994;
  Benedict, 1979; 
  Dromi, 1987;
  Gentner, 1982;
  Gentner, Boroditsky, 2001;
  Goldin-Meadow, Seligman, Gelman, 1976;

	- 45% of the 20-50 words vocabulary
	- 3% for verbs

- why nouns?

	- Natural Partitions Hypothesis

	  the physical world makes obvious the things that take nouns as labels, whereas the meanings that verbs encode, which is relational, have to be figured out from hearing the verb in use. Relational meanings are less available to young children through nonlinguistic experience.

		- relational meaning(verb) acquired through use not experience

	- Relational Relativity Hypothesis

	  Gentner, Boroditsky, 2001

		- verb do not naturally emerge from the structure of the world, verb varies from language to language

		  Cross-linguistically, one can find direct equivalents of nouns among languages, e.g. Spanish word for table, dog, chair. But verb are packaged differently. Bsp. the most frequently used English verb includes the manner of motion (walk, run, drive), but Spanish includes direction, e.g. salir(to exit), escalar(to go up), entrar(to enter). There are directional verb in English, but aren't frequently used.

	- Hypothesis: Children learn labels for object first, then labels for properties (adj) and relations (verb)
	- Silent videotape adult guess experiment

	  Gillette, Gleitman, Gleitman, Lederer, 1999:
	  Silent videotapes of mother-child interaction were played for adults whose job it was to guess the word that was uttered at the moment abeep was inserted into the tape. Adults were able to identify 45% of the nouns they had to guess, but 15% correctness for verbs

		- 45% right for guessing nouns
		- 15% right for guessing verbs

	- Grammar of target language

		- Korean/Japanese/Mandarin acquiring children show less noun bias than English acquiring children

		  In these languages, verb appears in the final position in sentences more frequently, and this position is particularly salient/noticeable to children
		  grammar allows noun dropping, thus making verbs relatively more frequent in input.

	- Cultural

		- maternal input difference

			- Japanese moms seldom do so
			- American middle-class moms spend tons of time labeling objects to child

- Extensions

	- Underextension

		- Bsp. use 'dog' to refer to collies, spaniels but not chihuahuas

	- Overextension

		- Bsp. call all four-legged animals 'doggie'; call all adult males 'daddy'
		- why?

			- 1) as an evidence of incomplete meanings (doggie case) N.B. this view is considered as incorrect

			  The child who calls all four-legged animals doggie knows something about the meaning of doggie but doesn't know all the features unique to dogs that are not present in horses, cows, and bears
			  Clark, 1973

			- 2) lack of more differentiated vocabularies lead to approximate comment (don't have 'horse', then use 'dog' to refer to horse)

			  It is not that the child really thinks the word for horse is 'dog'. It could be that the child just doesn't know or can't remember what the horse is called and wants to make some comment on it, and 'dog' is the closest word the child can find in his or her vocabulary.
			  see Hoek, Ingram, Gibson, 1986; Hudson, Nelson, 1984; Huttenlocher, Smiley, 1987

				- highly variable overextensions

				  the overextended uses have some component of meaning in common with the original referent of the word, but they don't seem consistent with a single, incomplete meaning like the earlier doggie case.

				- overextension is not common (33% of word uses)

				  Rescorla, 1980
				  Six children
				  12-18 months
				  33% of the children's word uses were overextended, but only a few different words accounted for a disproportionate share of those overextensions

				- incidence of overextensions declines as more differentiated vocabularies are acquired

				  Rescorla, 1980
				  Bsp. learning words for animals other than 'dog'

			- 3) are word retrieval errors, made as speech is produced

			  Gershkoff-Stowe, Connell, Smith, 2006

### Word Spurt

- also called Word Explosion
- occurred at 50-word achievement or at 18-month-old

  Benedict, 1979;
  L. Bloom, 1973;
  Nelson, 1973.

- Shift of gear

	- pre-word-spurt: 8-11 words per month

	  Benedict, 1979

	- word-spurt: 22-37 words per month

	  Benedict, 1979；
	  Goldfield, Reznick, 1990;

- Is there really a word spur?

	- No, the change is gradual and word spurt a myth

	  P. Bloom, 2000
	  The rate of children's word learning does accelerate in their second year, but the change for most children is a gradual increase rather than an abrupt change in rate. In individual cases, abrupt changes may occur for a variety of reasons. A child may briefly plateau, in which case a return to lexical growth might look like a spurt, or a child's word-learning opportunities might change. The child goes on vacation and is exposed to many new things will increase his or her rate of vocabulary learning.

	- Yes

		- Goldfield & Reznick 1990

			- 18 children from @14-month-old to 75-word mark
			- Four exemplar growth patterns

				- 13/18 showed word spurt
				- 5/18 showed linear vocabulary growth rate

			- "spurter" during spurts showed increase in proportion of object labels, "nonspurters" did not
			- criticize: the study time period is too short

		- Mervis & Bertrand 1995

			- after 75 word mark, apparent nonspurters did show a spurt

- underlying mechanism?

	- 1) the maturation of internal word-learning constraints

	  Behrend, 1990;
	  Mervis, Bertrand, 1994

	- 2) 50-word pool grounds children in lexicon learning

	  the pool gives children a basis for figuring out principles of how the lexicon works
	  see L. B. Smith, 1995, 2001;

	- 3) Naming Insight

	  McShane, 1980
	  Children achieve a naming insight at which point they realize that everything has a name

		- at 18-month, children realize words not for particulars but for object categories

		  Nazzi, Bertoncini, 2003

		- Children's understanding of object been able to group into categories coincides with word spurt

	- 4) developed phonological system contributes to lexical development

	  since phonological abilities influence children's early vocabularies 
	  see Stoel-Gammon, 2011; Vihman, 1996

	- 5) Results from incremental changes in underlying capacities 

	  It is possible that many changes in children's word-learning abilities occur after word learning begins with the result that word learning becomes increasingly efficient. It is also possible that an apparent discontinuity could result from incremental changes
	  see Elman et al., 1996; D. L. Mills, Conboy, Paton, 2005.

### Word Comprehension

- 5-month-old recognize their names

	- personal anecdote
	- experimental set-up

	  when presented with their own name and prosodically similar foils, infants prefer to listen to their own name
	  Mandel, Jusczyk, Pisoni, 1995

- Children understand phrase @8-month-old

  Fenson et al., 1994

- Children understand individual words @8-10 months old
- Comprehension vocabulary(CV) >> productive vocabulary(PV)

	- Fenson et al.

	  The test uses MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories.
	  The test is highly reliable because it is replicated many times, by Benedict, 1979; Bornstein, Hendricks, 2012; Clark, Hecht, 1983; Goldin-Meadow et al., 1976

		- >1000 English acquiring children
		- @10-month-old, top 10% children have CV=154; bottom 10% children have CV = 11; PV = 0 for all children
		- @16-month-old, CV = [92, 321]; PV < 50

- proportion of verb in CV > PV

  Benedict, 1979; Goldin-Meadow et al., 1976

	- why?

		- Communication works adequately with a minimal verb vocabulary

		  Gentner, 1978:
		  Bsp. The single verb 'go' can be combined with 'night-night', 'car', and 'park' to convey the meanings of three verbs: sleep, drive and play.

### Word Processing

- lexical presentation are built and improved gradually
- looking-while-listening test

	- speed of verb processing ∝ age
	- Spanish-acquiring children & "perro"

	  The graph displays the percent of time children aged 1½, 2 and 2½ years spent looking at the picture that matched the word "Perro", starting from the beginning of word presentation. The older children began to look at the target picture more quickly than did the younger children.

	- children increase in speed of verbal processing @15-25-month-old

	  Fernald, Perfors, Marchman, 2006; 
	  Fernald, Pinto, Swingley, Weinberg, McRoberts, 1998

## Individual Differences in Lexical Development

### Individual Difference in Language Style

- 1) some children acquire almost entirely referential words, while others context-bound words

	- why?

		- i) context that children hear the words

		  Words taught as labels and given explicitly definitions may be more likely to be used referentially from the beginning than words the child picks up from context.
		  If a word is used almost exclusively in a single context, the child would have no basis for figuring out its more generalizable meaning.

			- Evidence: Ferrier's daughter, 'phew' as greeting

			  Ferrier, 1978
			  Her daughter thought "phew" was a form of greeting because that's what her mother said to her when she entered her room each morning. Her mother was responding to the smell of the diaper the baby worn for the past 12 hours, but the baby didn't know that.

		- ii) (not adequate) some children adopt more analytical, as compared to holistic, approach to language acquisition

		  Peters, 1983:
		  analytical children divide language into small bits, e.g. word or parts of words; other children acquire big chunks, like to treat 'Don'tdothat' as a single word.
		  This view is not adequate as single word can also have context-bound meanings (Barrett et al.,1986).

		- iii) Risk-taker ∝ context-bound words

		  Some children may jump into talking with a minimal understanding of what they are saying, whereas other children may be more cautious, not using words until they are sure of what they mean.
		  The more cautious children would be expected to produce fewer context-bound words if children at this point in development know that their understanding of context-bound words is incomplete.

		- iv) Sociability ∝ context-bound words

		  A child who is very interested in social interaction would want a vocabulary of words to use in particular situations. Socially-inclined children will be more driven to use whatever means is available for interaction and thus be more likely to talk when his or her understanding of word meaning was still incomplete and tied to particular settings.

- 2) Referential language style(RLS) vs. expressive language style(ELS)

  In Nelson's 18 children research, children with a larger proportion of nominal vocabularies are referred as RLS, and those with less nominal but more personal/social words are ELS.

	- two ends of a continuum
	- why two styles?

		- i) Language-learning experiences

			- proportion of nouns ∝ frequency of mothers descriptive utterances that contain noun

			  Pine, 1994

			- referential children are more likely to be firstborn of college-educated parents

			  referential children are more likely than average to be the firstborn of college-educated parents (Goldfield, Reznick, 1990; Nelson, 1973)

			- more educated moms are more likely to engage in explicit labeling -> RLS

			  Lawrence, Shipley, 1996

			- later-born children have more unanalyzed chunks because they pick up from context

			  Pine, 1995

		- ii) Children's perception of language, as rather vehicle for referring to objects (leads to RLS), or as vehicle for social interaction (leads to ELS)
		- iii) Analytical approach children -> RLS; holistic approach children -> ELS

		  Bates, Bretherton, Snyder, 1988

	- RLS is NOT superior than ELS

	  It is important to note that:
	  Although in Nelson's research the referential children took less time to acquire the 50-word mark, but it is due to the fact that RLS kids produced their first word later than ELS kids.
	  Although in Bates et al., 1988 research shows that among children @13-month-old with vocabularies ranged from [2, 32], that proportion of object labels ∝ size of vocabulary, but it is because by the time when referential style was assessed, children already have different size of vocabularies. The referential/expressive distinction can only be applied when the size of vocabulary is held constant (Bates et al., 1994; Pine, Lieven, 1990).

### Individual Differences in the Rate of Lexical Development

- individual vocabulary growth difference R other aspects of language development

  Bornstein, Putnick, 2012; Feldman et al., 2000

- Great variation among children in terms of vocabulary size

	- MacArthur-Bates Inventory

	  N.B. this inventory does not count the actual total number of different words children use because they are based on the sample of words in the inventory. However, there is a relation between these inventory scores and children's total vocabulary sizes. (Mayor, Plunkett, 2011)

	- @8-16 months old
	- @16-30 months old

- why is there a difference?

	- Environmental Factors

		- Rich vocabulary language & frequent exposure -> faster vocabulary growth

		  Hoff, Naigles, 2002; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, Lyons, 1991

		- high Socioeconomic status (SES) -> faster vocabulary growth

		  Since parents from higher SES backgrounds tend to have bigger vocabularies in routine conversation, they also speed more time talking to their children.

		- birth order

		  Firstborns tend to have a slightly larger vocabulary than later-borns (Berglund, Eriksson, Westerlund, 2005; Fenson et al., 1994; Hart, Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2006b; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998; Pine, 1995) 
		  because they are more likely to experience more one-to-one interaction experience with an adult(Hoff, 2006).

		- informativeness of the context

		  Weizman, Snow, 2001.
		  
		  Mothers who say something about what the word means have children who build their vocabularies at faster rates.

			- long sentence = more informational

			  Bornstein, Haynes, Painter, 1998; Hoff, Naigles, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998.
			  Longer sentences are more likely to contain explicit information about word meaning. Bsp. 'That's a bat' vs. 'That's a bat hanging upside down in his cave'

			- explanation of new words for babies

		- maternal verbal responsiveness

		  Tamis-LeMonda, Bornstein, Kahana-Kalman, Baumwell, Cyphers, 1998; Tomasello, Todd, 1983
		  The effect of maternal verbal responsiveness, or mother-child mutual engagement has more significant effect on subsequent vocabulary development for children under 18-month-old

		- apropos of attention/vocalization

			- more likely to learn words if label is provided just after child's vocalization

			  Goldstein, Schwade, 2010; Goldstein, Schwade, Briesch, Syal, 2010

			- more likely to learn words if labels infant's current focus of attention

			  Tomasello, Farrar, 1986

	- Child Factors

		- speed of language processing
		- phonological memory
		- personality

		  outgoing child may elicit more input, which in turn promote more rapid language development (Slomkowski, Nelson, Dunn, Plomin, 1992)
		  Attentive temperament that results in children been easily accepted by others to interact also promote language development(L. Bloom, Capatides, 1987; Dixon, Smith, 2000)

	- Gender Difference: girl > boy

	  Bauer, Goldfield, Reznick, 2002; Berglund et al., 2005; Borstein, Haynes, 1998; Fenson et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2008

		- mothers talk more to girl babies than to boy babies

		  Cherry, Lewis, 1978; Halvorsen, Waldrop, 1970.

		- girls may demonstrates word-learning skills that its male peer do not possess

		  Katz, Baker, Macnamara, 1974; Naigles, 1995.

		- Vocabulary difference in terms of sex difference cannot be explained by input difference 

		  Huttenlocher et al., 1991

## Word Learning Process

### Word Segmentation

- cue to word boundary

	- language-general cue (used initially)

		- learn from distributional regularities @8-month-old

		  J. R. Saffran, Aslin, Newport, 1996

	- Language-specific cue

		- stress

		  In English but not French, a stressed syllable is likely to signal the beginning of a new word.
		  Not initially but by 9 months, children acquiring English use stress patterns as a clue to word boundaries (Thiessen, Saffran, 2003, 2007)

			- exists in English but not French

		- rhythm

		  Culter, 1994, 1996; Mehler, Dupoux, Nazzi, Dehaene-Lambertz, 1996; Thiessen, Saffran, 2003, 2007.

		- Phonotactics

			- 'top-dog'

			  Bsp. In English the word 'top-dog' is not likely to be a single word because two stop consonants are not usually adjacent within a word. @9-month-old babies prefer to hear sound sequences consistent with the phonotactics of their language rather than foreign words (Jusczyk, Friederici, Wessels, Svenkerud, 1993).

	- Infant-directed Speech (IDS)

	  Ratner, 1996

		- shorter multiword utterances & more frequent single word utterances -> less word boundaries to find
		- involves smaller vocabulary
		- same word appears more frequently

		  Hearing a word in single word utterances helps children segment those words when they appear in connected speech (Lew-Williams, Pelucchi, Saffran, 2011)

		- more stress and intonation & put new word in sentence final position -> word become more salient

		  stress and sentence final position makes sounds salient to young children (Echols, Newport, 1992)
		  new words presented in IDS are easier to learn than words in ADS (Golinkoff, Alioto, 1995)

### Word-Referent Mapping

- Indeterminancy of Word Meaning/Mapping Problem 

  An infinite number of hypotheses about word meaning are logically possible given the data the child has.
  How does the child hearing /kʌp/ know that it is the cup that is being labeled rather than the cup's handle, cup's color, cup's material or the content of the cup? Or, why is it a nominal label for cup but not a command like, 'Drink'?
  Quine, 1960
  Yet children, from 18-month to 6 yrs old, learn on average 9 words per day (Carey, 1978).

- Fast Mapping

  children link a new word they hear and a likely candidate meaning. 
  Fast mapping serves only as a partial meanings or as skeletal place holders for the full meaning of the word that will be gradually achieved as the child has more experience (Carey, 2010; Gelman, Brandone, 2010; Swingley, 2010). 
  First guess is surprisingly accurate (Swingley, 2010)

	- What is it?

		- Egg Piercer Experiment 

		  A child is presented with an array of four objects that includes three familiar objects for which the child has a word, (e.g. a bottle, a cup, and a ball) and one unfamiliar object the child would not have a word for, e.g., an egg piercer. Then the experimenter asks the child, "Can I have the ball?" After the child indicates the ball, the experimenter asks, "Can I have the zib?" By the age of 20 months, using this procedure, many children can conclude, on the basis of only this experience, that 'zib' must be the name of the egg piercer.
		  
		  Dollaghan, 1985; Mervis, Bertrand, 1994

			- @20-month, array of four objects
			- @15-month, objects <4

		- child develops hypotheses for one single exposure

		  Carey, 1978

	- How is mapping possible?

		- 1) Lexical Principles/Lexical Constraints: children's knowledge of how the lexicon work 

			- Whole-Object Assumption

			  Markman, 1991, 1994
			  Words refer to whole objects rather than part of an object or to a property of the object. This eliminates 'white', 'handle of the cup', 'being held in a hand' and the like as possible meanings of cup.
			  
			  Supported by 
			  word-learning experiments (Markman, Wachtel, 1988; M. Taylor, Gelman, 1988; Waxman, Markow, 1995)
			  speech errors, hot = stove

				- common comprehension errors: 'hot' is label for stove

				  It is not uncommon for very young children to think that 'hot' is the label for the stove, given the common experience of hearing 'Don't touch it; it's hot.'

			- Assumption of Mutual Exclusivity

			  Markman, 1991, 1994
			  Different words refer to different kinds of things. Bsp. members of the category labeled dog do not overlap with members of the category cow. 
			  In egg piercer experiment, children assume the new word cannot be a synonym for any of the words they already know, therefore points to the egg piercer (Markman, Wachtel, 1988).
			  Children @18-month-old hearing a novel word will look around for a novel object rather than take the novel word as a label for familiar objects in the view (Markman et al., 2003)

		- 2) Pragmatic Base

		  Clark, 1993, 1995.

			- Principle of Contrast

			  Different words have different meanings.
			  Allows multiple labels with different meanings, z.B. the category 'dog' and 'animal' are partially overlapped. This is allowed in Principle of Contrast but not in Mutual Exclusivity

			- Principle of Conventionality

			  The meaning of a word is determined by convention; it has to be agreed upon and observed by all members of a language community. Children know this and they try to learn the meanings of the words they hear.

			- word meaning = communicative intentions ≠ infinite logical hypotheses

			  Sufficed communication needs: Children know a new word has a new meaning because they assume the speaker is trying to communicate and thus would not have used an unfamiliar term if a familiar one would have sufficed (V. C. Gathercole, 1989)
			  Children figure out the meaning of the new words they hear by figuring out the communicative intentions of the other speaker (Baldwin, Meyer, 2007; P. Bloom, 2000; Diesendruck, Markson, 2001, Tomasello, 2001).

		- 3) General process of attention and learning are ample

		  L. B. Smith, 2001
		  When a child takes a new word as the label for a new object, it is because the new object was the most interesting thing around for the child to look at.
		  
		  This view is deputed (see Diesendruck, Markson, Akhtar, Reudor, 2004; Diesendruck, 2007).

		- 4) Input as a source of support

			- Environment can meaningfully support word-learning process
			- comprehension is by nonlinguistic context 
			- in IDS, adults provide explicit instructions about word meanings

			  Adults offer new labels and corrections of children's imprecise lexical choices. 
			  Adults provide information about word meanings. Bsp. "It's called an ell."

			- Objections: Not always the IDS case

			  A child's mother may open the door and say, "Whatcha doing" instead of "This is a door."; or the mother may say, "Eat your peas," when the child's thoughts are entirely elsewhere.
			  (L. R. Gleitman, 1990)

		- 5) Cross-Situational Information

		  Children collect and make use of information across multiple encounters with a word. /kʌp/ in single situation may refer to different things, but across situations a cup will always be there while referents of the other candidate meanings may not be.

			- Infants@12-month & @ 2-4 years use cross-situational information in word-learning

			  Akhtar, Montague, 1999; Smith, Yu, 2008

			- How?

				- i) statistical commonality analysis

				  Children calculate the statistical regularities across their multiple encounters with a new word such that the pattern--that a cup is the common element in all the instances of the use of /kʌp/--emerges from the child's data (Yu, Smith, 2007)

				- ii) sequential hypothesis testing

				  Children proceed by generating a hypothesis at each encounter with the new word and testing the current hypothesis against new data.
				  Supported by evidence that learning is influenced by the order in which information is presented (Medina, Snedeker, Trueswell, Gleitman, 2011).

		- 6) Syntax as a clue

			- Kneading hand in container

			  Roger, Brown, 1957
			  Children use grammar as a clue to meaning. This is demonstrated by showing preschool  children a picture of apir of hands kneading a mass of material in a container. He described the picture as "sibbing" to some of the children, as "a sib" to some of the children, and as "some sib" to others. Children interpreted "sib" as describing the action, the container, or the material, respectively, depending on which form they heard.

			- syntax provide clues for proper nouns, common nouns, adjectives and verbs

			  Preschool children use grammar to infer the meaning distinction between proper nouns like Lassie and common nouns like dog (S. A. Gelman, Taylor, 1984) as well as between nouns and adjectives (S. A. Gelman, Markman, 1985; Hall, Waxman, Hurwitz, 1993)
			  
			  Bsp. A verb like 'hit' means to do something to someone else. It usually appears in a sentence like "Tom hit Jerry". in which the verb is preceded by one noun, the doer, and followed by another noun, the recipient of the deed. Verb like 'laugh'  that refer to an action with no recipient appear in sentences like 'Tom laughed'.

				- "Fep" Experiment

				  Four-year-olds pick (b) when told, "Find the fep one," and they pick (c) when told, "Now find the fep." These response suggest that 4-year-olds can use the syntax of a sentence to distinguish between words that imply a contrast between members of the same category (adjective) and words that do not imply such a contrast (common nouns).

				- Rabbit-duck 'gorping' Experiment

				  Letitia Naigles, 1990
				  Two-year-old babies
				  Children watched a videotape of an action, which consisted of a rabbit repeatedly pushing a duck down in to a squatting position with its left hand while at the same time both the rabbit and the duck were making circles in the air with their right hands (rabbits and duck were actually graduate students dressed in costumes).
				  Some children heard the sentence: "The rabbit is gorping the duck." or "The rabbit and the duck are gorping."
				  preferential looking paradigm: children saw two actions simultaneously on two TV screens, one showed the rabbit pushing the duck and doing nothing else; the other screen showed the rabbit and the duck making hand circles
				  Ask children "Where's gorping now? Find gorping!"
				  Children who had heard the initial sentence "The rabbit and duck are gorping" looked longer at the screen on which the rabbit and duck were making hand circles.

			- Syntactic Bootstrapping Hypothesis

			  Knowledge of language structure is generally useful for learning new verbs.
			  proposed by Naigles, Swensen, 2007

- Dimension of word learning

	- ① Specificity Knowledge

	  Knowledge of lexical constraints is useful only for the task of learning new words.

	- ② Source of Support

	  Support within(Endogenous) or outside(Exogenous) of the child

	- P. Bloom, 200

		- 1) Understanding of mental states

		  social-cognitive understandings

		- 2) Understanding of the kinds of thing that get labeled (Cognitive bias)
		- 3) Understanding of syntactic clues for word learning (syntax)

	- Emergentist Coalition Model

	  Hollich et al., 2000; Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, 2008
	  This model integrates multiple word-mapping mechanisms

		- @Start: perceptual cues (most interesting/salient)

		  Children map a new word onto the referent that is the most interesting or salient.

		- @2-year: social-linguistic cues
		- Explain why verbs are acquired late

		  The meaning of verbs is less available perceptually and their acquisition depends more on the sources of information that children are able to use only later in development (Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, 2008)

### Word Extension

- Taxonomic Assumption

  Assume that words refer to things that are of the same kind. That words are categories of taxonomically related objects, e.g. 'dog' refers to all sorts of dogs but not collars, leashes, or bones (those are thematically related)

	- preschooler tend to group things thematically instead of taxonomically <- toy grouping experiment

	  Children are given a jumble of toys including toy people, animals and vehicles, and are asked to "put together the things that go together"
	  7-year-olds or older sort collection into a group of animals, group of people, group of vehicles etc (taxonomically related).
	  preschoolers group toy people with vehicles because people drive cars (thematically related)

	- puppet, picture, dog experiment <- children override thematic inclination when exposed to new words

	  Markman, Hutschinson, 1984
	  Use a puppet to present a picture of a dog to 2-3 years old children.
	  Present a choice between a thematically related item (dog food) and a taxonomically related item (a dog of different breed)
	  "no word condition": the puppet pointed to the first picture (of a dog) and said "Look carefully now. See this?" When choices are presented, asks "Find another one that is the same as this."
	  "word condition": at introducing first picture, "see this? It is a sud." when other choices are presented, asks "Find another sud that is the same as this sud."
	  In "no word condition" children chose taxonomically related choice 59% of the time; in "word condition", 83% of the time for taxonomically related choice.

- Children's conception of Objects, Substances & Form

	- "blicket", honey dipper & face cream experiment

	  Soja, Carey, Spelke, 1991
	  
	  Present children with a new word by saying, "This is my blicket" and show them either an object or a substance. The objects were things like apple corers and honey dippers, and substances things are face cream and hair gel, all of which 2-year-olds are unlikely to have words for.
	  
	  If children saw plastic honey dipper, ask children "Point to the blicket." and provide a wooden honey dipper (form of object) and pieces of plastic (substance). Children chose wooden dipper.
	  If children saw a glob of face cream (substance), ask "Point to the blicket" then provides a similar-shaped glob of hair gel and an arrangement of lots of little dots of face cream. Children chose the arrangement of little dots of face cream.

- shape & appearances but not color or texture guide extension

  L. B. Smith, Jones, Landau, 1992

- Bias to use shape for extension emerges at 50-word mark 
- For human artifacts, infants consider the design intention when categorizing and labeling things

  P. Bloom, Markson, 1998; S. A. Gelman, Bloom, 2000

	- bear-shaped blob experiment

	  S. A. Gelman, Ebeling, 1998
	  Ask 2-year-olds to name the thing portrayed in a picture. Some of the pictures were described as purposefully created, others as created by accident. The children were more likely to call a bear-shaped blob a bear if they thought it was made on purpose than if they thought it was the result of an accident.

### Word Form Encoding

- Sound sequence & meaning of word can be acquired separately 
- Children identified many "words" before knowing the words meaning

  Swingley, 2005

- children @18-month are better at word-learning if been previously exposed to novel words without explanation of meaning

  Swingley, 2007

- Novel words learned from distributional analysis grants children advantages in word-learning

  Graf Estes et al., 2007

## Learning Semantic Organization

### How language divides the world into word-sized packages?

Bowerman, 1978
state this question

- Children sometimes invent "words" to fill lexical gap

  e.g. 'couch hole' refers to the cracks between cushions that a 2-year-old has to be careful to avoid when walking across a couch; or a 'pee mat', the bathmat in front of the toilet that the child stood on when urinating

- variation in verb encoding

  To describe this scene, an English speaker would say, "The girl is running out of the house," encoding the manner of the motion in the verb. A Spanish speaker would say, "La nina esta saliendo de la casa" (the girl is leaving the house), encoding the direction of the motion in the verb. N.B. there are words in English that encode the direction of motion and there are words in Spanish that encodes manner of motion, but these words are not frequently used words.

- color olive&chromium experiment: what are lexicalized in target language

  Carey, 1978
  3-year-old children exposed to novel words for color in naturalistic context(preschool environment).
  Children are pretested to make sure no children know a word for olive or chromium.
  During the kindergarten time, teacher presented two identical trays one of color chromium and one of color blue. Then in the course of setting up snacks, preschool teach asked children to "Bring me the chromium tray; not the blue one, the chromium one."
  Children received a 2nd exposure a week after using the same trays.
  Children were tested 5 weeks later and found that:
  0/14 learn to call olive 'chromium'
  2/14 who in  pretest called olive 'green' now claimed that they don't know what to call it
  6/14 called olive a color term, e.g. grey, blue, brown.
  N.B. although children had not learned the word chromium, they realized that olive was a color that had its own name. Children had figured out that this particular concept is lexicalized (has a name) in their language, even though they don't know what the name is.

### Semantic Organization

The process of organizing the world that mediates between cognitive organization and language.

### Lexical Organization

The process of how children learn the semantics of their language with respect to the lexicon

### Preference for language-specific verb interpretation

- @2-year-old all children use direction verb; @3-5 years old children use language-specific verb interpretation

  Experiment done on English-, Spanish-, and Japanese-acquiring children shows this. See Maguire et al., 2010

- Korean/English verb encoding differences observed on 1-year-old children

  In English, the same words are used to describe the path of motion (such as up or down) regardless of whether the motion is caused(e.g. He pushed me down) or spontaneous(e.g. I fell down). In Korean, path is lexicalized with cause. In English, path is lexicalized independent of cause.
  1-year-old English-acquiring children commonly use the words 'down' and 'up' for both spontaneous and caused motion; Korean children do not extend verb meanings in this way.
  (Choi, Bowerman, 1991)

- English/Spanish adult speaker showed preference for different verb encoding

  when given a novel verb presented with a videotaped motion, e.g. "She's kradding toward the tree" and "She's kradding the tree", adult Spanish speakers tend to favor a path interpretation and adult English speakers favor a manner interpretation (Naigles, Terrazas, 1998).
