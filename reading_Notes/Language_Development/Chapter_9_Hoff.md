# Chapter 9 Hoff

## Social Circumstances

### Order of Acquistion

- Simultaneous Bilinguals/Bilingual First Language Acquisition (BFLA)

  who are exposed to two languages from birth.

- Sequential Bilinguals

  Who begin language development as monolingual speakers but who acquire a second language later in childhood. Could happened if a family is immigrated to a new country, or learn the tribal language first then the national language (Cummins & Corson, 1997):
  Inuit of Canada,
  Maori of New Zealand, 
  Saami of Norway, etc.

### Heritage Language

the Language of the culture in which children's parents (both mom & dad) were born

### Minority Language

Language not used in government, business, or school, but only in the immigrant community.

### Large variation in input environment

- Child in Flemish Belgium, De Houwer 1995

  Child living in the Flemish region of Belgium, where Dutch and French are official languages. The child goes to French-medium music school, Dutch-speaking preschools, French-using maternal grandparents, Dutch-using paternal grandparents, French-speaking babysitters and French-speaking children that the child played with.

- Child in New Delhi India, Nair 1984

  The child's father's and paternal grandmother's language is Bengali, mother's Malayalam; parents use their native language & English to communicate with the child but use Hindi & English to talk to each other. The household employees use other Indian languages and dialects to talk to the child.

- Social prestige of the language
- Changing amount & kind of exposure due to caregiving arrangements change

  Pearson, Fernandez, Leweddeg, Oller, 1997

- child go to preschool/school -> increase use of community language at home

  Bridges, Hoff, in press

## Bilingual Development Studies

### History

- linguistics' diary records

	- Famous Werner Leopold's 4-volume study on his daughter who was acquiring English and German (1939-1949)

- large-scale on children in immigrant families, more emphasis on majority language skills

### Current Field

- motivation

	- Studies in Bilingual development can shed light on nature of human language acquisition capacity

	  Genesee, 2006; Genesee, Nicoladis, 2007; Hoff, Rumiche, 2012

	- Bilingual development is not a special case of normal language acquisition
	- Narrowing the achievement gap

	  children from language minority homes have lower levels of academic achievement than non-minority children in U.S. and elsewhere (National Center for Education Statistics, 2006; Scheele, Leseman, Mayo, 2010)

- why literatures don't agree with each other?

	- Bilingualism is a different phenomenon depending on varying factors

	  Hoff, McCardle, 2006; Oller, Jarmulowicz, 2007

	- An umbrella term rather than monolithic phenomenon

	  Hoff, McCardle, 2006

- Psycholinguistic aspects are addressed in this book; childrearing, teaching, and clinical concerns are not addressed

  The latter are addressed in Paradis, Genesee, Crago, 2011; Pearson, 2008; Tabors, 1997

## BFLA

### Language Differentiation

- Hypothesis

	- 1) Fusion Hypothesis: 1 system for 2L

	  Children initially create one system that combines the two languages they hear.
	  Volterra, Taeschner, 1978

		- Stage 1: 1 lexicon contains words in both languages
		- Stage 2: distinguish 2 lexicons but apply same syntactic rule to both languages
		- Stage 3 @ 3-year-old: children fully differentiate two systems.

	- 2) Differentiation with Autonomous Development Hypothesis

	  children differentiate the two languages they hear and acquire each uninfluenced by the other

	- 3) Differentiation with Interdependent Development Hypothesis

	  children differentiate the two languages they hear but the course of development of each is influenced by the other.

- Phonological Differentiation

	- Perception

		- Stress Processing

		  e.g. record and record in English denotes a verb/noun difference; /papa/ (potato) and /papa/ (father) in Spanish denotes a semantic difference; in French stress is not a phonological feature that carries meaning.

			- Difficult to develop two stress processing system
			- Proficient adult bilinguals process stress patterns using their first & dominant language

			  Cutler, Mehler, Norris, Segui, 1992;

			- Adult BFLA use majority language to process stress patterns 

			  Dupoux, Peperkamp, Sebastian-Galles, 2010

		- Phonology categories

			- Bilingual U-shaped development

			  Polka, Rvachew, mattock, 2007

				- 1) Start off as universal listeners @4-month
				- 2) Phase of not noticing contrasts that apply in only one of their languages @8-month
				- 3) Tuned to the categories of 2 Ls @12-month
				- Catalonia Spanish studies

				  Bosch, Sebastian-Galles, 2003:
				  In Catalonia region of Spanish, there are 3 kinds of households:
				  Catalan-only family,
				  Spanish-only family,
				  Catalan-Spanish family.
				  Researchers make use of the contrast between /e/ and /ɛ/ in Catalan but not in Spanish to test children in the above three households. 
				  Spanish, Catalan and Spanish-Catalan children @ 4 months & Catalan and Spanish-Catalan children @ 12 months perceive the contrast, but Spanish-Catalan children failed to perceive it @ 8 months old.

				- why?

					- Not inability to distinguish but different responding mechanism

						- Bilingual children show ability of discrimination in AEM test but not in attention recovery test

						  Albareda-Castellot, Pons, Sebastian-Galles, 2011
						  AEM = anticipatory eye movement 
						  
						  The high ratio of cognates in Spanish and Catalan may underlie the reason why bilinguals failed to discriminate the native vowels when tested with the familiarization-preference procedure but succeeded with the AEM paradigm.
						  
						  Also see Sebastian-Galles, 2010

					- 'Longer universal listener period' for acoustically complex environment

					  Petitto, Berens, Kovelman, Dubins, Jasinska, Shalinsky, 2011: Bilingual children keep their options open longer than the monolingual infants who live in acoustically simpler environment

					- Depends on language-specific contrasts in question & quality of input

					  Sebastian-Galles, Bosch, 2009; Werker, in press; Werker, Byers-Heinlein, 2008

		- ❌ One-Parent-One-Language (OPOL)

		  the advice originates from a linguist colleague of Louis Rojat, see Reich, 1986; Ronjat, 1913.
		  The logic behind OPOL is that the child never hears two languages from the same parent, thus avoiding confusing the child.

			- no body of research behind OPOL
			- use of both Ls is normative in bilingual communities & in home domain

			  Place, Hoff, 2011

			- Many parents of bilingual children do not follow OPOL

			  De Houwer, 2007; Lanza, 2001

			- Parents who claim to follow OPOL frequently do not

			  Goodz, 1989

		- English-Tagalog children differentiate between L1 and L2

		  Although using the HAS (high amplitude sucking paradigm) there is a lack of preference between English and Tagalog input for bilingual children, but it can be demonstrated that the babies born to bilingual mothers were able to discriminate English from Tagalog (Byers-Heinlein, Burns, Werker, 2010)

	- Produciton

		- Current researches are inconclusive
		- 13 babies @10-14 months do not babble differently in English- or French-speaking context; across contexts babies show French consonantal features (Montreal Canada)

		  Poulin-Dubois, Goodz, 2001

		- Case study: English-French baby babble differently when interacted with French-speaking father or English-speaking mother (Montreal Canada)

		  Maneva, Genesee, 2002

		- Older children have distinctly different phonological features when speaking different languages

		  Ingram, 1981; De Houwer, 1995

		- no apparent confusion between phonologies of 2 Languages

		  Hoffman, 1991

		- Case study @ 3-year-old: produce words in one language with phonological features that only belonged to another language

		  Burling, 1959; Fantini, 1985;

		- Spanish-English children @2-year-old in Florida: 2 lexicons & 2 grammatical system are processed through a single phonological system, that of the dominant language

		  Navarro, Pearson, Cobo-Lewis, Oller, 1998:
		  Word produce by Spanish-English bilingual children in south Florida are tested. The words they produced are excerpted from tape recordings and played for judges who were asked to identify and if they couldn't identify the word, identify instead the target language. The judges' performance are only better than guessing. 1/3 of children's words are unassignable to a target language

- Lexical Differentiation

	- Degree of Overlap

	  If the child has words in each language for the same things, then the child has two systems. 
	  Principle of mutual exclusivity also lend support to this view, that a child will reject a new word that is synonymous with a word they already know in the same language.

		- Children @4-year-old override mutual-exclusivity principle and accept two names of same objects if they perceive the two names as coming from different languages

		  Au, Glusman, 1990

		- Method: count No. of translation equivalents in child's vocabularies

			- Difficulty 1: unclear criterion of how much overlaps count as watershed of two systems
			- Difficulty 2: bilinguals hear different languages from different people in different context, thus resulting in different vocabularies

			  Pearson, Fernandez, 1994; Pye, 1986

		- large-scale researches suggests a separation of lexicons

		  Genesee, Nicoladis, 2007

			- Spanish-English children in south Florida @8-30 months: 30% vocabularies were translation equivalents

			  The authors argued that this is a sufficient degree of overlap to suggest the separate linguistic systems. 
			  Pearson, Fernandez, Oller, 1995

			- French-English & French-LSQ BFLA children showed [36%, 50%] overlaps 

			  LSQ = Langue de Signes Quebecoise, a sign language used in French-speaking Quebec.
			  Petitto et al., 2001

- Morphosyntactic Differentiation

  If children acquired two systems, then they shouldn't build sentences using elements from both languages.

	- No fusion stage observed, children develops two grammatical systems from the start

	  De Houwer, 2005; Paradis et al., 2011

		- French-German BFLA children do not use French words in German word order or vice versa

		  Meisel, 1989

		- French-English children place negative marker before verb in English and after verb in French

		  Genesee, Nicoladis, 2007;
		  Bsp. do not like; n'aime pas.

	- Is language mixing evidences for language confusion?

		- No, Meisel 1989
		- No, because it could be result of lexical gap in one language filled by another language

		  Genesee, 1989

		- No, because adults who know two languages constantly mix them together (personal data)

	- Global differentiation of two languages

		- Bilingual children show awareness of which people in their environment understand which language 

		  Genesee, Nicoladis, 2007;
		  Bsp. A French-ENglish bilingual child uses French more frequently with those she knows speak only French and English more frequently with those she knows speak only English.

		- Young children show better-than-chance selection of languages depending on listeners

		  Deuchar, Quay, 1999; Lanza, 2001; Nicoladis, Genesee, 1996; Petitto et al., 2001

### Effect on Language Development

- ① Effects on the Course of Language Development

	- Similar course like that of monolinguals

		- Vocabularies

			- pattern of vocabulary composition change follows the separate developmental courses within each language

			  Conboy, Thal, 2006; Marchman, Martinez-Sussmann, Dale, 2004.

			- social function verbs first -> nouns -> few verbs

		- Grammar

			- similar course within each language(using grammatical development's correlation with vocabulary development)

			  Conboy, Thal, 2006; Marchman et al., 2004; Parra, Hoff, Core, 2011

- ② Effects on the Rate of Language Development

	- Can human language acquisition capacity handle two languages?

		- Yes

		  Petitto et al., 2001

		- ❌  Yes and they can acquire both languages at same rate as monolinguals

		  Rejected by more recent studies.

			- Reason why it contradicts with other recent findings

				- 1) small sample size
				- 2) bilinguals not compared to matched peers but with published norms of monolingual development

				  The claim in such studies are usually "the bilingual children fall within the normal range of variation for monolingual children" (Paradis, Genesee, 1996; Petitto et al., 2001; Petitto, Kovelman, 2003).
				  However, the normal range of variation in the rate of language development is large. See Bialystok, 2001; Bialystok, Feng, 2011

	- BFLA children are slower in terms of vocabulary & grammatical development when measured in each language separately, compared with monolinguals

	  Bialystok, Feng, 2011; Bialystok, Luk, Peets, Yang, 2010, 2009; Gathercole, Thomas, 2009; Hoff et al., 2012; Marchman et al., 2010; Place, Hoff, 2011; Vagh, Pan, Mancilla-Martinez, 2009

	- Global rate of acquisition is not slower

	  when BFLA children's vocabularies are combined, they are of the same size of that of the monolingual peers. 
	  See Hoff et al., 2012; Patterson, Pearson, 2004; Pearson, Fernandez, Oller, 1993; Pearson, Fernandez, 1994.

		- Spanish-English BFLA studies

		  Using MacArthur-Bates inventories, Spanish-English BFLA children and English-acquiring children are compared in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Data summarized in figure.

	- Vocabulary Lag persists throughout lifetime

	  It is also observed in school-aged children for the lag in vocabulary. And it is proposed that this difference in vocabulary is a lifelong difference because vocabulary development does not have a point at which it is complete.
	  See Bialystok et al., 2009; Bialystok, Feng, 2011; Gathercole, Thomas, 2009; Oller, Pearson, Cobo-Lewis, 2007.

	- Grammatical Lag ends @10-year-old

	  Grammatical lags are observed throughout school years. (Gathercole, 2002a, 2002b, 2002c)
	  But given optimal circumstances of continued and consistent exposure to two languages, bilingual children may catch up to monolingual @10-year-old (Gathercole, Thomas, 2009).

- ③ Profile Effect

  Oller et al., 2007
  The term refers to the situation that the overall profile of language competence in bilingual children can differ from that of monolingual children. 
  Bilingual children typically have different amounts and different kinds of experience in their two languages, e.g. 
  hear one more than the other
  be read to in one but not the other
  different conversational partners
  All these differences can produce multiple patterns of bilingual proficiency (Bialystok, Peets, 2010).

### Sources of Variability

- The success rate for bilingual development among children in bilingual households ≈ 75%

  De Houwer, 2007; Pearson, 2007

- Variable Properties of Bilingual Environments

	- societal factors

		- relative prestige of 2 languages

		  Children do not want to speak the language that is less prestigious. As they use it less, they hear it less and become less likely to acquire it (Pearson, 2007).

	- heritage language culture

		- Dialectical variabilities

		  Bsp., Mexican and Dominican immigrants all speak Spanish, but differ in the patterns of interaction they have with their children. (Song, Tamis-LeMonda, Yoshikawa, Kahana-Kalman, Wu, in press)

		- Culture backgrounds in dual language homes

		  In the Netherlands, Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch bilingual developments are different because Turkish-speaking households frequently have books in Turkish and have a tradition of literacy. Moroccan speakers speak a language (Tarifit-Berber) that does not have a written form. See Scheele et al., 2010.

	- household composition

		- De Houwer, 2007 in Flander Holland
		- when only one parent speaks a heritage language, the community language dominates

		  Place, Hoff, 2011

		- Children who attend school tend to use the schooling language at home and increase others' use of that language in home

		  Bridges, Hoff, in press

	- Effects of Length of Dual Language Exposure

		- Spanish-English children @22-30 months old

		  Children whose homes were English dominant were stronger in their English skills, children whose homes were Spanish dominant were stronger in their Spanish skills, and children who experienced relatively balanced input were relatively balanced in their language skills (Hoff et al., 2012).
		  N.B. that on average all children have English as their dominant language regardless of household compositions.

		- Is there a threshold effect?

			- Yes, 60-80% of that of the monolingual exposure is necessary for acquisition

			  It could be the case that children may ultimately stop using and thus stop learning a language in which they have low skill levels (Jia, Aaronson, 2003; Pearson et al., 1997)

			- No

				- Children who hear 20% of input in Spanish learned some Spanish

				  Hoff et al., 2012; Place, Hoff, 2011.
				  Children's productive language development shows a strong linear relation to the relative amount of input they receive in that language.

	- Effects of Properties of Dual Language Exposure

		- Book reading is particularly supportive

		  Patterson, 2002; Song et al., in press

		- Exposure via TV is not particularly supportive

		  Patterson, 2002

		- Hearing from more speakers > from fewer speakers

		  Place, Hoff, 2011:
		  Density of talk:
		  in 30 minutes with several speakers results in more IDS than with just one speakers
		  Richness and variability in input

		- intermingle of 2 languages

			- might not be as useful a database as input as separate input

			  Byers-Heinlein, in press
			  
			  When language mixing occurs within sentences, some of the cues that children use in word learning might be obscured.

				- parents intrasentential language mixing negative related to comprehension of vocabularies @1½ years old

				  Bayers-Heinlein, in press

			- children's experience of 2 languages in same contexts is not related to language development

			  Place, Hoff, 2011

		- Input from native/nonnative speakers

			- Children with native Spanish-speaking parents talking more English to them did not have stronger English skills, but did have weaker Spanish skills 

			  Hammer, Davison, Lawrence, Miccio, 2009

			- children @2-year-old in Spanish-English bilingual homes: proportion of English exposure from native speakers is a positive predictor of children's English skills

			  Place, Hoff, 2011

			- Immigrant children in Canada: amount of English exposure at home is positive predictor only when their parents had high fluency in English

			  Paradis et al., 2011

## Childhood 2nd Language Acquisition

### Two view on age-cutoff between sequential and simultaneous bilinguals

- Cutoff is arbitrary

  Appel, Muysken, 1987

- non-arbitrary cutoff

	- prenatal bilingual exposure affects language preference

	  Byers-Heinlein et al., 2010

	- bilingual exposure @4-month affects speech perception

	  Bosch, Sebastian-Galles, 2003

	- International adoptees begun @2-year-old not equivalent to exposure from birth

	  Gauthier, Genesee, in press

### Course of 2nd Language Acquisition

- Stages of communicative strategies

	- 1) Native language using

	  though it is not understood by the ambient community

	- 2) Nonverbal/silent period: communicate via gesture
	- 3) Limited 2nd language using, use only memorized phrase that serves social purpose
	- 3.5) Interlanguage use: source of speech errors

	  Interlanguage is a systematic and rule-governed system, different from the target form of the new language. This is the source of speech errors during the acquisition of 2nd language.

		- i) developmental errors

		  same kind of errors made by monolingual children during their course of acquisition

		- ii) language transfer errors

		  Due to the interlanguage system

	- 4) Productive 2nd language using

- Canada immigrant children: 21 months exposure to English, 40% children within normal range for grammatical morpheme production; 65% for receptive vocabulary; 90% for story grammar

  Paradis, 2007

	- N.B. it is within normal range, not reaching the average level of that of monolinguals
	- N.B. only oral competence is tested

- Academic language development

  Academic language is used to refer to the style of language used in schooling: the vocabulary is more varied and more abstract, the grammatical structures are more complex, and the structure of discourse is different (Schleppegrell, 2001).

	- Children with adequate oral skills for peer interaction ≠ have academic skills for describing complex ideas and abstract concepts

	  Westby, Hwa-Froelich, 2010

	- Takes 4-8 years to acquire proficient academic language required for schooling

	  Collier, Thomas, 1989; Cummins, 2000; Paradis et al., 2011

- What happened to 1st language?

	- Case 1: 1st language lost altogether

	  L. W. Fillmore, 1991, 1996

	- Case 2: Dominant language switch

		- Chinese immigrant children to New York: below 9 years old, there is a dominant language switch, above 9, no switch

		  Jia, Aaronson, 2003
		  Children who were under the age of 9 when they immigrated were found that they were more proficient in English, as measured by several tests of grammatical knowledge and translation, 3 years after moving. Children above 9 maintained their preference for Mandarin and remained more proficient in Mandarin than English over the three years of the study.

			- younger children has more English-speaking friends
			- younger children spent more leisure reading time on English

		- Spanish-English children in south California: learn Spanish first at home, then learn English @school @5-year-old: make progress faster in English, more proficient in English by middle childhood

		  Kohnert, 2002; Kohnert, Bates, 2002

			- measures speed of speakers' performance on a picture-word verification task

### Process of 2nd Language Acquisition

- Properties of 1st language influence hypothesis formation -> predict speech errors

  Bialystok, Hakuta, 1994; Kellerman, 1986;
  Children's native language influences the errors they make while learning the 2nd language.

- Input conditions

	- 1st L: one-on-one dyadic interaction with native speakers
	- 2nd L: thrown into situations, sink or swim

		- First memorizing large chunks of speech to use for communicative purpose, then gradually analyze the chunks into component parts

		  Wong Fillmore, 1991; Heath, 1983

		- Bates' daughter: 1st = English; when thrown into Italian family, she learned socially useful expressions in big, unanalyzed chunks

		  Bates, Bretherton, Snyder, 1988

### Influences on 2nd Language Acquisition

- Characteristics of Children

	- language specific capacities

		- phonological memory

			- (large scale) children @4-7 years old as newcomer to Canada: phonological memory strongly ∝ English acquisition

			  Paradis, 2011

			- Children in classroom setting learning foreign language: phonological memory ∝ success

			  Service, 1992; Service, Kohonen, 1995

		- Language aptitude test's score ∝ rate of 1st L acquisition

		  Skehan, 1989, 1991

	- General learning capacities

		- children (newcomer to Canada): analytic ability ∝ English skill

		  Paradis, 2011

	- Personality variables

		- faster acquisition rate in socially competent children compared to shy children

		  In setting in which the speakers of the target language outnumber the target language learners, children who are socially competent learn the language faster than children who are shy and less socially competent. (Oades-Sese, Esquivel, Kaliski, Maniatis, 2011; Wong Fillmore, 1991)

		- Low anxiety level & high willingness to communication ∝ success in 2nd L acquisition

		  Segalowitz, 1997

	- Age

		- Older children make more rapid progress in 2nd L learning than younger children

		  Paradis, 2011; Snow, Hoefnagel-Hoehle, 1978

		- Ultimately younger children have better mastery of grammar and speak without accent

		  Flege, 1995; J. Johnson, Newport, 1989

	- Similarity between 1st & 2nd L

		- Canadian newcomer: if 1st L is Mandarin or Cantonese, acquire English slower; if 1st L is Spanish or Punjabi, acquire English faster

		  Paradis, 2011

- Characteristics of Environment

	- Type of environment

	  See Lambert, 1977

		- Additive bilingual environment

		  The first language continues to be supported as the learning of second language is also fostered.

		- Subtractive bilingual environment

		  The second language is supported at the expense of the first language

	- Motivation

		- Instrumental Motivation

		  Include reasons such as needing to speak a foreign language for employment purposes

		- Integrative Motivation

		  Include a desire to be part of the foreign-language-speaking community.

	- Ethnic Identity

	  It has an influence on bilingual development. See Tse, 2000.

	- Total assimilation?

		- Yes, most successful learning occurs on children who are totally assimilated by the new speech community and their 2nd L becomes their dominant L

		  Jia, Aaronson, 1999

		- No, don't need to give up identity or being assimilated, given that there is a supportive sociocultural attitudes

		  D. M. Taylor, 1987

	- Language Attrition

		- widely observed first language attrition

		  Bylund, Abrahamsson, Hyltenstam, 2009; Montrul, 2005.

		- South Florida: balanced bilinguals @2-year-old become English dominant @4-year-old

## Code Switching

To deliberately choose what language to use.
It is linguistically constrained, rather than a random jumbling of elements from two languages (Toribio, 2011).

### (adults) for pragmatic purposes

- to specify who is addressed/add emphasis by repeating in another L/convey certain emotion

  Appel, Muyksen, 1987; Grosjean, 1982

- Set tone for conversation: majority L for formal & less personal; minority for personal connection & identify speaker as who related to minority L group

  Cashman, 2005

- To exclude someone from conversation: upper class of Imperial Russia use French so their servants know nothing about conversation
- As a style

  Auer, 2005; Toribio, 2011

### How about children?

- bilinguals @2-year-old shows contextual sensitivity in their language use

  Genesee, Nicoladis, Paradis, 1995; Lanza, 1992; Genesee, Nicoladis, 2007

- French-English bilinguals @5-year-old address their English/French native parents use the language native to their parents

  Comeau, Genesee, 2001; Nicoladis, Genesee, 1996

- bilinguals @3-year-old shows awareness of two language by repairing their misunderstood utterance by switching to the other L

  Comeau, Genesee, 2001

## Cognitive Consequences of Bilingualism

### historical studies

- 1930s-1940s: bilingualism is bad for intelligence
- Bilingual immigrants have poorer performance than native monolinguals

  N.B. native monolinguals tend to have higher SES compared to immigrant at that time

	- 1) immigrants were genetically inferior
	- 2) bilingualism caused the devoid of advantages 

	  "Bilingualism in young children is a hardship and devoid of apparent advantage" (Yoshioka, 1929)

- Peal & Lambert 1962 study on French-English Canadian children with matched SES: bilingualism is an advantage

  "Youngster whose wider experiences in two cultures have given him advantages that a monolingual does not enjoy. Intellectually his experience with two language systems seems to have left him with a mental flexibility, a superiority in concept formation, and a more diversified set of mental abilities."

### Advantages associated with bilingualism

- Metalinguistic Awareness

  Awareness of how language works and the ability to think about language. Usually tested using tasks that require an understanding of the arbitrary nature of sound-meaning correspondences and tasks that require separating meaning from form.

	- bilinguals outperform monolinguals in "Can the turtle(airplane) fly?" test

	  Children were playing a game in which an airplane was called a "turtle" and then asked things like "Can the turtle fly?," bilingual children were better able to answer than monolingual children (Ben-Zeev, 1977).

	- "Wug" test: bilinguals sometimes outperform; it depends on the specific language

	  Barac, Bialystok, 2012

	- Phonological awareness

		- predictor of reading success
		- bilingual children sometimes outperform monolingual peers; depends on language

		  See Barac, Bialystok, 2012;
		  Bsp. Spanish-English bilingual children were better at counting the number of phonemes in words than English monolingual children, but Chinese-English bilingual children were not (Bialystok, Majumder, Martin, 2003).

- Tasks measuring theory of mind understanding; False-belief task

  Goetz, 2003; Kovacs, 2009

- Executive function

  A set of cognitive abilities responsible for attention, selection, inhibition, shifting, and mental flexibility (Barac, Bialystok, 2011)

	- advantage can be found in as early as @2-year-old

	  Poulin,Dubois, Blaye, Coutya, Bialystok, 2010

- better at following a pattern that changes/learning two simultaneous presented patterns

  Kovacs, Mehler, 2009a, 2009b

- less age-related decline in cognitive control for lifelong bilinguals

  Bialystok, Craik, Klein, Viswanathan, 2004

- Delay the onset of dementia in some cases

  Bialystok, Craik, Freedman, 2007; Chertkow, Whitehead, Phillips, Wolfson, Atherton, Bergman, 2010

### Source of advantage

- Knowing 2 Ls -> metalinguistic awareness
- Using 2 Ls -> executive function
- Evidence

	- Language immersion programs in school

	  See Bialystok, Barac, 2012;
	  Children who were at different stages in the process of becoming bilingual through their attendance at language immersion programs in school were found that the metalinguistic awareness task's performance is related to degree of proficiency in the acquiring language; and executive function task's performance related to how long they had been in the program.

	- Tasks that make different executive function demands

## The Bilingual Brain

### Unequal effects of brain damage

- Lost native Swiss German but retain French, Italian & Standard German when had a stroke

  Minkowski, 1927; cited in Obler, Gjerlow, 1999

- Due to brain tumor: lost 3rd & 4th learned language but retain native and 2nd learned language

  Albert, Obler, 1978

### Brain

- Brain activities in tasks requiring bilingual

	- Multiple language tasks use same area of brain, for both 1st and 2nd L

	  Klein, Milner, Zatorre, Meyer, Evans, 1995; Klein, Milner, Zatorre, Zhao, Nikelski, 1999

	- Chinese-English bilinguals & ERPs: age of acquisition affects brain areas used by syntactic processing; influence: syntax > semantic

	  Chinese-English bilinguals who were all native speakers of Chinese and who began acquiring English at different ages have their ERPs recorded during certain tasks. It is found that the age at which English was acquired affected the brain activity associated with performing tasks in the language. Moreover, in terms of brain activity, the syntactic processing was more affected by age factor, and so is the performance. Curiously, syntactic processing received more influence than the semantic processing.
	  See Weber-Fox, Neville, 1996

	- fMRI: early & late bilinguals use same part of Wernicke's area; late bilinguals but not early, use different part in Broca's area for 2 Ls

	  Tasks are given in both their first and second languages. Same part of Wernicke's area was recruited for tasks in both languages by both groups of subjects. Late bilinguals but not the early bilinguals, showed that different parts of Broca's area were recruited for tasks in the first and second languages. 
	  Wernicke ≈ semantic
	  Broca ≈ syntax
	  See Kim, Relkin, Lee, Hirsch, 1997

	- Language proficiency may be the confounding variable

	  Abutalebi, Cappa, Perani, 2005;

	- Even if bilinguals perform equally well, have same brain areas recruited, there could be other difference in neurophysiological aspects: e.g. blood oxygenation level

	  early Spanish-English bilinguals asked to perform a sentence judgment task  while recorded on fMRI showed: same level of speed and accuracy and brain area recruited, as compared to English monolinguals, but when processing English, bilinguals showed a greater increase in blood oxygenation levels.
	  See Kovelman, Baker, Petitto, 2008.

- Brain structure: greater density in gray matter in left inferior parietal region were found in bilinguals

  Mechelli et al., 2004

## Educating Bilingual Children

### Context & Types of Education

### The French Immersion Program (Canada)

Large experiments begun in the Canadian province of Quebec in 1965.
Aim: to teach French to English speaking population.
Method: teach part of the school curriculum in French.
Results:
Children achieve higher levels of French proficiency compared to English students doing traditional foreign language education
when children are assessed at the end of elementary school, no effect of French immersion on English skills are observed.
Children remain dominant in English and do not show skill levels in French equivalent to native speakers.
Children consistently report working harder than students in regular school programs.
