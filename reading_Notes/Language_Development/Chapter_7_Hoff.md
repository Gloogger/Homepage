# Chapter 7 Hoff

## Component of Adults' Communicative Components

### Linguistic vs. Communicative competence

- Linguistics

	- Ability to produce & understand well-formed, meaningful sentences.

- Communicative

	- Ability to use sentences appropriately in communication

### Communicative Competence

- Pragmatics

  Speaking is "doing things with words" (Austin, 1962)

	- Speech Act Theory (SAT)

	  When I say "I thereby announce you husband and wife", then I thereby announce you husband and wife.

		- Examples of speech act

			- demanding
			- Arguing
			- Describing
			- Referring
			- Requesting
			- Promising
			- Announcing

		- Components of SAT

			- illuctionary force

			  its intended function, could be 
			  request
			  query
			  promise

			- locution

			  its linguistic form, could be
			  declarative
			  imperative

			- perlocution

			  its effect on the listener, could be 
			  obtaining requested object,
			  transmitting information

	- Intentionality

		- been interpretable DOES NOT imply been communicative  

			- Bsp. Sneezing is a reflex and therefore not a communicative act

		- What is intention?

		  See Grice 1957, 1969

			- To create belief in listeners' mind ✔️
			- achieve the intended goal in the content ❌
			- varies according to form  and literal meaning

			  Bsp. The following sentences has the same intended function, but expressed in different form:
			  Open the window.
			  Would you open the window?
			  I'd love some fresh air.
			  It sure is stuffy in here.

- Discourse

	- Connected Discourse

		- Are longer stretches of speech
		- participants ≥ 2 -> Conversations
		- participants = 1 -> Narratives

	- What is good conversation?

		- Grice's conversational maxims

		  See Grice, 1957, 1975

			- ① To take turns
			- ② To be cooperative
			- ③ Quantity

				- as informative as required, neither too much nor too little
				- speak the conceived truth

			- ④ Relation

				- Be relevant

			- ⑤ Manner

				- Be perspicuous, clear, brief, orderly, unambiguous

	- Narrative require unique competence for children

	  Sustaining talk without a conversational partner and making that talk coherent place unique demands on a speaker's communicative competence. The beginnings of narrative development can be found in the spontaneous descriptions of past events children produce in conversation, starting before the age of 3.

- Sociolinguistics

	- Registers

		- Are styles of language use associated with particular social settings
		- Variation in culture

			- across different languages

			  E.g. Scandinavians are know for not talking a great deal of registers (Tryggvason, 2006), Israelis are know for bing extremely straightforward in their speech (Katriel, 1986)

				- Scandinavians: not too much
				- Israelis: not at all
				- Japanese: used a lot

			- across different regions of the  same language

				- rude New Yorkers and polite southerner

			- across gender

			  The kinds of conversations that occur among men are different from the kinds of conversations that occur among women (Tannen, 1990).

	- Language socialization

	  The process of learning to use language in a manner consistent with the norms of your social group.

## Pragmatic Development

The development of the use of language to serve communicative functions

### Infants lack intention of control

### Absence of intentional control distinguishes reflexive behavior from true communication

Oller, 2000

### Development of Speech Act

- When does intention first appear?

	- Bates et al., 1975

		- 3 girls

			- 2 mths
			- 6 mths
			- 12 mths

		- visit every 2 week, record with videotape and note keeping
		- reveal 3 phases

			- Phase 1: Perlocutionary

				- @birth - 10 mths
				- i. has effect on listener
				- ii. makes no effort to communicate

			- Phase 2: Illocutionary

				- @10 - 12 mths
				- illocutionary force ✔️
				- perlocutionary effect ✔️
				- locutionary form of target language ❌
				- protoimperatives

					- A child who wants something will not just reach and fuss but will actively try to elicit another's aid in obtaining that object.

				- protodeclarative

					- use objects to direct adult attention

						- providing information to adult
						- expressing interest in an object

			- Phase 3: Locutionary 

				- @12 mths and beyonds 
				- has communicative intentions
				- in adultlike form

### Expanding range of communicative functions of speech

- First Functions of Language
- Primitive speech acts at the one-word stage
- more frequent production of intents & more various types of intents

	- Ninio, 1995

		- @10-22 mths, type of communicative intents in 30-minute interaction increased from 3 to >30

	- Snow et al., 1996

		- @14-20 mths frequency of communicative intentions doubled from 4 per 10-minute to 8

- Content change

	- Adamson, Bakeman, 2006

		- @18-30 mths
		- @18 mths, more here-and-now
		- later, more other places, other times, and about internal states

	- Sachs, 1983

		- @24 mths, refer to absent objects and use language imaginatively in intended play

- Examples of communicative intentions @1½ yr

## Development of Conversational Skill

### Central questions

- How are they different from adult-to-adult conversations?
- What causes these differences

### Two Approaches

- Piaget's Theory

	- Collective monologues

	  Child 1: I'm gonna put on my gloves. Are you finished making your dog, honey?
	  Child 2: Almost.
	  Child 1: Good.
	  Child 2: I'm gonna get his nose on. Some of the parts are the same. This mechanical dog is more than I thought it was gonna be. He's taking it back. This will work.
	  Child 1: This is nice. Oh, this is nice.

		- each speaker's turn has little to do with previous speaker's turn
		- preschool children's speech is not really communicative

		  See Kohlberg, Yeager, Hjertholm, 1968; Piaget, 1926

		- "unable to place himself at the point of view of his hearer" (Piaget, 1926, p. 9)
		- "no desire to influence his hearer or to tell him anything" (Piaget, 1926, p. 9)

	- Skill & Will

		- Skill: children lack cognitive ability

			- Preschool child is egocentric

				- preschool children have difficulty with describing a visual array from different vantage point 

				  R. Gelman, Baillargeon, 1983

		- Will: not trying to engage in dialogue

			- Private Speech

				- children are particularly likely to talk to themselves when alone and engaged in tasks and in play

				  Winsler, Carlton, Barry, 2000; Winsler, De Leon, Wallace, Carlton, Willson-Quayle, 2003

				- Solitary Monologues

					- used for language exploration & practice 

					  Gallagher, Craig, 1978; Nelson, 1989; Weir, 1962

					- Presleep soliloquies

						- Weir, 1962

						  Children produced substitution exercise in beds, e.g.
						  	Mommy's too weak
						  	Alice strong
						  	Alice too weak
						  	Alice too weak
						  	Daddy's too weak
						  	Too weak with Barbara
						  	Be careful Barbara

						- Nelson, 1989

						  @

- Vygotsky's  Theory

	- Private speech

		- Not language exploration but instead behavioral self-guidance
		- An intermediary stage during which the child is overtly producing the self-talk that will eventually be internalized

	- Evidences

		- The kind of talk adults provide children does improve the children's task performance

		  See Behrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1992; Wood, Wood, Middleton, 1978

		- The private speech children produce during a task predicts their later performance on the same task

		  Behrend et al., 1992

### Early Conversational Skills in Interaction with Adults

- The turn-taking structure of early mother-child interaction appears to depend on mothers' building a conversational structure around their children's behavior (Shatz, 1983)
- Responding to speech

	- Children use strategies
	- Early strategy: children respond with action so as to fulfill the conversational obligation

		- Ask 2-year-olds questions for which an action response would not be appropriate, Shatz (1978b) found sometimes children responded with action anyway

		  E.g. "Why don't you wear shoes on your head?" one child promptly removed his shoes from his feet and placed them on his head

- Differential responding to different utterance types

	- Children start to respond more frequently to talk with talk and also to respond differently to different kinds of utterances (Shatz, McCloskey, 1984)
	- More likely to respond to questions than to nonquestions

	  Hoff-Ginsberg, 1990; Shatz, 1983

		- "What" acts as an early signal to the child that action is not an appropriate response 

		  Allen, Shatz, 1983

		- "why" seem particularly difficult for children

		  Blank, Allen, 1976

	- performance outstrips child's understanding

		- Children who cannot correctly identify any colors but who know several color words will reliably answer the question "What color is this?" with a color term (incorrect color).

		  Shatz, 1983

		- "What time is it?" the child replies, "four-eighty"
		- preschoolers were more likely to repeat their entire utterance in response to a general query and to repeat only the requested utterance part in response to a specific query

		  Anselmi, Tomasello, Acunzo 1986

		- 1-2 years olds' abilities to participate in conversation are based on a mixture of partial understandings and strategies for participating despite only partial understandings.

- Topic initiating

	- Topics are what conversations are about
	- Type of topic initiation (in order of acquistion)

		- 1. about themselves
		- 2. things in environment
		- 3. absent/intangible things
		- The development of topic initiation skills is note solely a matter of developing language skill

			- Late talker at age of 1 yr 10 mths initiate a topic about a cat in the back garden with gestures 
			- Language skill and communicative skill are to a degree independent
			- Successful conversations with young children are supported by the motivation of their conversational partners

- Repairing Miscommunication

	- A necessary conversational skill: to respond to communicative failures by repeating or revising the message
	- Preverbal negotiations of failed messages (Golinkoff, 1983)

		- when adults fail to understand children's noises and gestures, children often persevere, repeating or modifying their signal until they achieve the desired outcome
		- at mealtime interactions, @3 mths olds, half of their efforts at communication were initially unsuccessful; but by repeating, revising, or substituting a new signal, the children were ultimately able to be successful 55% of the time @1 yrs and 72% at 1½ yrs

		  Golinkoff, 1986

	- Young children (1-3 yrs) tend to simply repeat the misunderstood message; older  children (3-5 yrs) tend to revise their message

	  See Anselmi et al., 1986; Brinton, Fujiki, Loab, & Winkler, 1986; Furrow, Lewis, 1987; Gallagher, 1977; Tomasello, Farrar, Dines, 1984; Wilcox, Webster, 1980

- Sustaining dialogue and contingent responding

	- A salient change in children's conversational abilities after 2 years old is an increase in the length of conversation children are able to sustain
	- Roger Brown, 1980

		- 21 children all aged @ 30 mths, MLU ranged from 1.0 to 3.0. Found that the number of topically related utterances for MLU=1.0 is on average less than 1, for MLU=3.0, the related utterance is over 20.

	- L. Bloom, Rocissano, Hood, 1976

		- four children's adult-child interaction are recorded. Children are divided into 3 stages: Stage 1 (MLU<2.0), Stage 2 (MLU = 2-2.75), Stage 5 (MLU = 3.5-4.0). Children are aged between 21 mths to 36 mths.

			- 

				- produce a contingent utterance requries

					- 1) retrieve information from memory
					- 2) formulate a message and attending to the ongoing interaction
					- 3) Attending to the content of the prior speakers' message

				- Contextually contingent: "It is" followed by a prepositional phrase that describes a location

					- Adult: "Where's the other sock?" Child: "See my sitting on it"

				- Linguistically contingent: use the right sentence structure in response to the prior speakers, e.g. why in S1, because in S2

					- Adult: "Pussycat is calling to wolf. Why?" Child: "Because he's up in this building too tall."

			- Result

				- the frequency of contextually contingent responses declined with age, whereas the frequency of linguistically contingent responses increased

	- The Role of Adult

		- maternal speech characteristically includes a very high proportion of questions, and children are more likely to respond to questions than to other types of utterances (Hoff-Ginsberg, 1990)
		- Mothers' use of 'turnabouts', which respond to the child's prior utterance and request further response

### Young children's peer conversations

- Will

	- @2 yrs old, children initiate interactions 80% of the time with adults and 20% with peers. Children's initiation were successful in obtaining a response 80% of the time, and when they did not receive a response, they tried again with a revised message more than 50% of the time. (Wellman, Lempers, 1977)
	- twin 2 yrs olds sons alone in their room did attend to each other's speech and produced related utterances (Keenan, 1974)

- Skill

	- 3-5 yrs olds, able to sustain sequences of talk ranged from 4-12 exchanges in length, between 21-77% of the conversation are contingent (Garvey, Hogan, 1973)
	- @4 yrs old, conversational segments are 23-70% dialogues, length of dialogue is on average < 12 utterances for 75% of the topics. However, the longest stretch of dialogue is 91 consecutive utterances. (Schoeber-Peterson, Johnson, 1989)

- Context has a great influence on conversation

	- when children share contextual knowledge, their conversations are longer and their language use is more advanced than when they do not share background knowledge. (French, Lucariello, Seidman, Nelson, 1985)
	- preschool children who know each other and interact regularly have shown how young children use their language skills to create and maintain relationships (Katz, 2004).
	- preschool children create roles for each other in pretend play (Kyratzis, 2007).
	- preschool children negotiate the conflicts that arises (Kyratzis, Guo, 2001).

## Narrative Development

### The conversational origin of narratives

- Three phase of presentation of past experiences (Eisenberg, 1985)

	- Phase 1: adults provide scaffolding for children by i) introducing a past event as a topic ("Did you go to the zoo?") and eliciting more information on the topic ("What did you see there?")
	- Phase 2: children depend less on adults' scaffolding; children tend to use general event knowledge rather than specific experience to describe a past event, e.g. a child's recounting of a birthday party might include things that didn't actually occur at that birthday party but that are typical of birthday parties in general
	- Phase 3: children's narratives depend less on either the scaffolding or the general event knowledge; they can include more information that is unique to the particular event being recounted

- Two styles of adults' scaffolding on past experience conversations

	- Elaborative style: characterized by questions that help the child say something that moves the narrative forward

		- elaborative style helps children to produce better narratives (McCabe and Peterson, 1991)
		- The complexity and structure of the scaffolding helps to develop the complexity and structure of children's utterance (Fivush, 1991)

	- Repetitive style: characterized by questions that seek the same information over and over again
	- Two styles comparison

### Developmental Changes in Children's Narratives

- less dependent on adults' support
- increase in length of narratives produced
- increase in frequency of spontaneous mention of past events

	- 23% of the conversation @3-year-old to 35% @5-year old. (Umiker-Sebeok, 1979)

- increase in the remoteness of the past event
- increases in the structural complexity

	- 1.7 clauses @3-year-old to 2.8 clauses @5-year-old (Umiker-Sebeok, 1979)

- increase in the narrative devices such as orienting to time and place and evaluating the events

	- @3-year-old, simply a mention of the past event; @4-5 years old, produced plot elements of a story (Umiker-Sebeok,1979)

- Quality of narratives depends on content

	- negative events (e.g. injury) tend to have more dramatic structure than stories of positive events such as a trip to the zoo (Reese, Sparks, & Suggate, 2012)
	- Fictional narratives are harder than personal experience

	  Children were presented with a story through a picture book or film clip, and then asked to retell the story. This task is more difficult for children than the personal narrative. See Resse et al. 2012; Shiro, 2003

## Sociolinguistic Development

### 3 Major Accomplishments

- 1) Use of situationally appropriate language
- 2) Understanding that people in different social roles use language differently
- 3) Use of language in gender-typed ways

### Learning to Produce Situationally Appropriate Langauge

- Tests

	- Referential Communication test

		- Children were asked to describe one item in an array of objects so that a visually separated listener with the same array can identify the item.
		- @4-5 yrs old, children are not very successful at this task. They will use "Daddy's shirt" to describe a geometric form and "another Daddy's shirt" to address another different form (Glucksberg, Krauss, & Higgins, 1975).

	- Naturalistic settings

		- Tests that focus on one speech function and look at the different ways in which children express that function in different situations
		- children use different forms of request

			- they can state their goal ("More juice"); they can issue direct imperatives ("Book read"); they can state the problem that needs solution ("Carol hungry"). See Ervin-Tripp, 1977
			- @2-3 yrs children also use question-form requests (e.g. 'Would you push this?', 'Can you give me one car, please?'). See Ervin-Tripp, 1977
			- @3-5 yrs old children have more than one form for expressing requests at their disposal (Doral, 1977; Garvey, 1975)
			- one 2-year-old child used simple imperatives to other 2-year-olds; used imperatives with 'please' to 3-year-olds; used questions to 4-year-olds (Lawson, 1967).

		- Children as young as @3 yrs can productively control over the degree of politeness of their requests (Bates, 1976)

			- Children nanny candy experiment

			  Italian children were introduced to a hand puppet representing an elderly gray-haired woman named Signora Rossi (Mrs. Rossi), who had lots of candy. Children were informed that Mrs. Rossi would give them a piece of candy if they asked for one. After the children made their first request, the experimenter pretended to confer with the puppet and told the children: "Mrs. Rossi said that she will surely give you a candy. But, you know, she's a bit old, and she likes it when children are very, very nice. Ask her again even more nicely for the candy." Regardless of how they formed their 2nd request, the children were given candy.

				- 1. shown that older children (3 yrs 5mths to 4 yrs) used more varied forms in 2nd request 
				- 1. shown that both older and younger children were able to use a different and less direct form in 2nd request

	- Children's Child-Directed Speech

		- Piaget's water tap experiment

		  6-year-old children were shown a diagram of a water tap and given an explanation of how the tap worked. The children were then required to explain how the tap worked to a peer. It is found that children's explanations of the water tap to be inadequate in several ways. They did not order their explanations properly or explain causal connections between elements in the explanation in a way that would ensure listener comprehension.

			- Figure
			- Explanations

		- naturalistic experiments

			- asked 4-year-olds to explain to their mothers and to 2-year-olds how a toy dumping station worked (Shatz, & Gelman, 1973)

				- speech to adults have a longer MLU and more frequently included complex constructions
				- speech to 2-year-olds involved more frequently devices to secure and direct the listener's attention such as Hey, Look, and Watch.

			- 4-year-olds were recorded in free play with their mothers, a peer, a baby @1-2 yrs old, and a baby doll. 4-year-olds made modifications to their speech to the baby and the baby doll. (Sachs, & Devin, 1976)
			- Speech children address to a younger child is more directive, has a higher frequency of attention-getting devices and repetitions, has a lower frequency of questions, and in general is less attuned to the young child. See Dunn and Kendrick, 1982; Mannle and Tomasello, 1987l Tomasello and Mannle, 1985; Vandell and Wilson, 1987
			- when older siblings interacted with younger siblings, they spent less time than mothers did sharing the attentional focus of the young child (Tomasello, Mannle, 1985)
			- As children get older, their child-directed speech becomes more like mothers' child-directed speech (Gleason, 1973; Hoff-Ginsberg, & Krueger, 1991)

### Children's Understanding of Registers

- Children often exaggerated stereotypes about social rules in terms of their speaking manner

	- Andersen, 1986, 1990: examined children's knowledge of role-related register by asking them to play-act different roles in different settings with puppets

	  A 5-year-old in the family setting with a mother puppet, a father puppet, and a young child puppet was found that children differentiated among the following styles of speech associated with the role:
	  voice quality,
	  the sentence forms used,
	  the content of talk,
	  the choice of vocabulary.
	  For instance, when playing as the father role, the child spoke loudly and in a deep voice, the sentences were shorter than those of mothers' but longer than sentences spoken as the child. Topic contains more about work, e.g. "fire that secretary". Involves more direct imperatives.

### Early Gender-Typed Language Use

- preschool girls are more likely to ask help from adults, even when the need (putting the puzzle together) is not greater, as compared to preschool boys (Thompson, 1999.)
- boys interrupted girls twice as frequently as girls interrupted boys (Esposito, 1979)
- Boys tended to use simple imperatives in talking to their partner in pretend play, e.g. "Lie down," "Gimme your arm"; girls in the same role used language that included the other child in planning, .e.g. "Let's sit down and use it," "I'll be the doctor for my baby and you be the doctor for your baby." (Sachs, 1987)
- when conflicts arose, boys issued directives and make threats; girls tend to use language to negotiate a settlement (Amy Sheldon, 1990).
- Girls used more talk oriented toward conflict resolution than boys did (Killen and Naigles, 1995)

## Influences on Communicative Development
